DjGz9s60R9I,Only 300 people turned up to see this ????
DjGz9s60R9I,"even in women's football, the referee is against Madrid, it's so sad :("
DjGz9s60R9I,"When it‚Äôs not Linda it‚Äôs Alba, or Eva, Lakrar, Athanea, Weir - they‚Äôre beginning to play like a solid team from top to bottom in the last leg of the Liga F season,  ;-)"
DjGz9s60R9I,Who has paid the referee?
DjGz9s60R9I,"Athenea's GOLAZO should NOT have been cancelled. There is absolutely no foul whatsoever before she scores, the ref literally invented a foul... Alba doesn't control the ball with her hand, nor does Yasmim foul the Badalona player. Even the English commentator was left without words at such an idiotic decision. Let me add, there was also a penalty on Eva which wasn't given and a yellow shown to Athenea where she didn't even touch the Badalona player... it must be said that all game they were flopping like they were being shot from a cannon."
Wx6ihpqjzpg,"Barca Men‚Äôs team - üóø
Barca women‚Äôs team - üíÄ"
Wx6ihpqjzpg,"It's been awhile since I watched barca highlights.  I forgot how great they are. As far as I can tell, there is no one better in Women's football at Club level.  That does not mean they will win every game, but overall, there is none better."
Wx6ihpqjzpg,"This Barcelona team, is amazing"
Wx6ihpqjzpg,Our ladies can score Man United
Wx6ihpqjzpg,this team can easily beat current Man Utd male squad.
Wx6ihpqjzpg,is this same real Madrid or dif Madrid?
Wx6ihpqjzpg,Great matchüíô‚ù§Ô∏èüíô‚ù§Ô∏è
Wx6ihpqjzpg,"What a goal from Lopez...Barca femini dominated and she just run a lone on the top..Alexia, Bonmati, Pina ,Eva, Lopez, Graham ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§Bravo Barca"
Wx6ihpqjzpg,what a free kick from mapi! ‚ù§
Wx6ihpqjzpg,This girls will always deliver ‚ù§
Wx6ihpqjzpg,"Mapi Leon was the Woman of the Match. Her directing the offense was amazing. Her goal and her brilliant passing. She passed one to Rolfo that was superb. Rolfo had a great goal, but she couldn't dribble past anyone and she was more likely to lose the ball than doing anything with it. She's been terrible all season. Last season when Rolfo was injured, Ona took control of that side and was spectacular. This season with Rolfo being reinstated and Ona on the other side has been awful. That's the coach's fault. Jana had the best game I've seen her play. Surprisingly strong and confident. Bonmati and Kiko were two others that had a great match:)"
Wx6ihpqjzpg,Schertenleib moving her hair out of the way before scoring ü•∂
Wx6ihpqjzpg,"Hello, does anyone know what channel is broadcasting women's soccer on TV?"

Al-VY9kFTfI,Why isn't Alisha Lehmann not playing?
Al-VY9kFTfI,Juventus with another huge win over Fiorentina as both teams still have to face each other in the Playoff Tournament and the second leg in the Semi Final of the Italian Womens Cup.. Barbara Bonansea on the scoresheet yet again and Martina Rosucci coming on and rather help Juve attack.. she helped out defensive duties playing very well covering left back and right centre back.. Rosucci should of started üòÇ

5_F_rWSzC5A,I was so baffled when mary wasn't allowed to wear tape ü§î never seen that before lol
5_F_rWSzC5A,Another huge win for PSG in their race for 2nd place against local rivals Paris FC.. Lyon and both Paris Clubs have already qualified for next season Uefa champions league since the other teams behind them can no longer catch them.. Let's hope soon to be League Champions Lyon helps PSG by beating Paris FC on the 12th April..

6etVVAHpxm8,Looks like musiala now has a female counterpart.
6etVVAHpxm8,The amazing thing is that she prefers kicking with her right foot and yet she uses her left foot as if that is her main kicking foot. That's amazing skill right there. She definitely has the potential to be one of the best football players in the world.

Bayer Leverkusen must win every single remaining League game against SGS Essen, Hoffenheim, Carl Zeiss Jena, Werder Bremen, Bayern Munich, FC Koln, Potsdam, RB Leipzig and VFL Wolfsburg.."

dF9uUhS5w20,"Really enjoyed Harder when she was playing on Chelsea. Mostly header goals here, but I thought her playmaking was some of the best in women's soccer. Glad she is doing well."
dF9uUhS5w20,Hello Heppy new Year
dF9uUhS5w20,"nice goals, but what really makes her stand out is her game intelligence and her huge influence on the team. the goals are just a very nice bonus imo."
dF9uUhS5w20,Hello garals Heppy new Year
NG35REVSBe0,"While everyone is talking about Barcelona, Lyon, Arsenal, Chelsea or City, Bayern Munich can become this season's dark horse. 
Flawless during their first five games, they had a bit of bad luck during round 6 against Arsenal.
If they can get more shots on target and be more accurate in the conversion of their chances, Bayern will be a serious danger for the aforementioned big five."
4568qaQCpEY,"Sorry, but Bayern should have won"
4568qaQCpEY,Min 20'20 b√πhl what a look ü§®
4568qaQCpEY,Why does it not let me watch the match live on here but then after the match it lets me
4568qaQCpEY,Corner arsenal!
4568qaQCpEY,"i would say it was a 2-2 game, lucky to get a penalty so late."
4568qaQCpEY,Now we want to play Chelsea ladies next
4568qaQCpEY,"Far too much training, back and forth, pushing and above all playing back without need from FC Bayern. The midfield players had more of a pull to the back than to the front. Managing - that acts as a weakness for your own team and as an incentive for the opponent. That's boring for the viewer - as a viewer you switch off beforehand. The next day you have the proof in the result that this behavior was punished again."
4568qaQCpEY,Rene has done an unbelievable job. Complete 180 from Jonas. Deserves the job full time.
4568qaQCpEY,"Pity the game was at Meadow Park. Should have been at the Emirates. Nevertheless, I expected Arsenal to win this one. This is a completely different and better Arsenal than the one that lost 5-2 in Germany.

Bayern did not lose this group in London. They lost it after the draw in Norway. Those were highly expensive points thrown away. If Bayern had won in Norway, this 3-2 loss would still bring them the group victory due to head-to-head result. Now Bayern will face a group winner = Barcelona, Lyon or Chelsea. Just like the She-Wolves, who will face Barcelona, Arsenal or Chelsea.

Having said this, Bayern and the She-Wolves have to batter themselves up, otherwise quarter final will be their terminus and Barcelona, Lyon and two of the English teams will proceed to the semis.
On a positive note: quarters are March 2025, so there are still three months of time to improve."
4568qaQCpEY,Great game
4568qaQCpEY,YOU FOUGHT FOR IT ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
4568qaQCpEY,"Rene you've got my love, respect and support"
4568qaQCpEY,What did I just watch? Turgid football and goalkeepers that I just cannot believe get paid actual real money
4568qaQCpEY,What a turn around this interim coach has done
4568qaQCpEY,Bayern should've played Tanikawa
4568qaQCpEY,"Pure Englische Fankultur bei 2:58, ein eigener Chant f√ºr van Domselaar. Gotta love traditional English fan culture, if only the tickets were still affordable for the dedicated, creative lot..."

rHsD2Mz7I3o,"What a match,  üëç I guess they'll meet each other again in the final. üòÉ"
rHsD2Mz7I3o,Manchester City as a club appear to be deliberately losing.
rHsD2Mz7I3o,"It was an easy task for Barcelona. This is because Manchester City only has a goalkeeper behind the midfielder.

It's as if Manchester City doesn't have any defenders. Barcelona must score more.

Manchester City's defenders disappear when defending, but appear when attacking and destroy all chances without moving the ball forward."

6RMX6lO2sgY,A GOLAZO by the way üòÇüáπüá©üá≤üá¶
OmEfo0t3hFk,"Jonsdottir is almost like Wolfsburg's Lewandowski. Funnily, he scored his five goals in eight minutes namely against Wolfsburg.

I was very disappointed to see almost every goal being caused by insane mistakes in defense, though. That couldn't be Champions League level"
OmEfo0t3hFk,Incredible night for J√≥nsd√≥ttir. It's like everything she hit went in.
OmEfo0t3hFk,4:00 it was already over !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OmEfo0t3hFk,She Wolves üòäüòä.... I supposed the mens team is referred to as He Wolves or not??
OmEfo0t3hFk,Wowow‚Ä¶ AS Roma get smashed‚Ä¶üòÖ
OmEfo0t3hFk,"First ever hat-trick for Sveind√≠s in her professional club career - and what a time to get one! ü§©üòé
been following her since watching her play against Barcelona couple of years back. shes incredible"
OmEfo0t3hFk,"Took her 20 minutes to get to #2 in the top scorer list, what a legend"
OmEfo0t3hFk,"The way Italian women have declined over past couple of seasons is sad after the promise shown from 2019 to 2022. Technical nations like Italy & Portugal, even Spain, need to find taller, faster & stronger players locally to make an impact internationally. Specially 1.8M goalie and efficient strikers. Physicality of the she-Wolves finally broke down the relatively petite Italians.
More work needs to be done by the Wolfsburg defense. Not clearing the ball properly under pressure inside the box needs to be addressed. The decisive goal in final against Barca & the reply by Roma in this match being 2 examples of panicking in tight spaces."
OmEfo0t3hFk,"Really disappointed with Roma this season. Felt like they really held their own last time round, but they really seem to be struggling with the level in the UWCL. Sadly that has been true across the board this year, as we've seen some ridiculous scorelines just in the group stages. Disappointing as you want matches to be as competitive as possible."
OmEfo0t3hFk,J√≥nsd√≥ttir is wonderful player üî•
OmEfo0t3hFk,"An extraordinary night for Wolfsburg and particularly Sveind√≠s Jane J√≥nsd√≥ttir, an eventful one to be on commentary for, to score four goals as a substitute is incredible! You might have noticed I primarily refer to her as 'Sveind√≠s Jane' not 'J√≥nsd√≥ttir' as one would for say a German player by default. That's because German names are formally shortened to the surname. Icelandic names are formally shortened to the first name. The name ‚ÄúYonsd√≥ttir‚Äù is not a surname; it‚Äôs a patronymic. It identifies who the person‚Äôs father is. In this case, literally, the person is ‚ÄúSvayndees Jane, daughter of Yons‚Äù It would be considered inappropriate in Iceland - and indeed sexist ‚Äî to shorten a woman‚Äôs name to ‚Äúdaughter of Yons‚Äù. In the context of a women‚Äôs professional footballer, referring to each player primarily by the name of her father, not by her own name, would be considered highly sexist in Iceland.

The result means Wolfsburg are into the quarter-finals for a 12th season in 13, last season the only exception. The She-Wolves have also won eight of their last nine games. For AS Roma, it's the second time in a row they have been been drawn in a really tough group, and missed out on reaching the knockouts, so the priority now becomes retaining the Italian Serie A League and Coppa Italia cup domestic double they won last season."

KgfQIVUd9tM,"I don't get it, she (Mickenhagen) won the ball. Ref cost Leverkusen the 3 points."
KgfQIVUd9tM,"I find it really hard to watch these games and not just be angry at how unequal the whole thing is. The way the commentator acts as if these are two equal teams, when it‚Äôs far from that. Leverkusen have to play out of their skin to beat the them with all the star names. And it‚Äôs hardly some big achievement when Bayern came back. Even without the second yellow, it was always likely that the higher quality team would come back and win the game. We need some honesty about how unequal this sport is. Rather than papering over it by pretending it‚Äôs a fair contest. It isn‚Äôt."

_NFnX02Mumc,"This bayern team is so perfect

Imagine Oberdorf comes back with stanway and Sarah midfield trio with Lohman and Buhl on wings with Harder upfront 
this attack will be ruthless"
_NFnX02Mumc,Tromp Path
_NFnX02Mumc,7:06 horrendous marking.
_NFnX02Mumc,Arsenal need a better keeper. Been saying this for years now
_NFnX02Mumc,that goal celebration music is terrible. it's a football match not a circus
_NFnX02Mumc,Hatrick Harder in 15mins - Mind Blowing!!!
_NFnX02Mumc,"And I just popped in here real quick to thank you for your infinite wisdom of putting THE SCORE IN THE TITLE!
Now I don't have to search your channel for the actual game, or even watch the rest of this clip - Brilliant, well done you üòè"
_NFnX02Mumc,It seems like Pernille Harder has been scoring Champions League goals in pairs
_NFnX02Mumc,No player interviews? I wanna hear what leah williamson thought what happened in the game
_NFnX02Mumc,"On paper you may be inclined to think this was a meeting of two giants of the game, the thing is Arsenal women's have only recently become one of the ""bigger sides"" of the Women's Super League, and haven't got a reputation in Europe yet, they just have their name and the fact their men's side is regarded as one of the better teams in European football, however Arsenal women's is an up and comer, whatever they achieve this season will be something the look to build on next season.

Man City and Chelsea are the real CL contenders of the English teams, Arsenal will probably reach the quarter-final at most, which would be a respectable showing for them."
_NFnX02Mumc,The Harder they certainly come!!
_NFnX02Mumc,Arsenal allways disapoints.
_NFnX02Mumc,Harder and her headers üëè
_NFnX02Mumc,You cannot blame the keeper for that shocking marking jheeez
_NFnX02Mumc,A result like that makes it look like Jonas has lost the dressing room! What's he signed the former Villa keeper to be there no 1 and she's on the bench for the champions league games?? üòÆ
_NFnX02Mumc,Nearly 60% of the goals were scored from set-pieces and were headers.
_NFnX02Mumc,"This is what happens when you rely on Zinsberger as your keeper. Drop the dead weight. Zinsberger, Foorde and Jonas OUT."
_NFnX02Mumc,pernille harder the great dane!!ü§©
_NFnX02Mumc,Arsenal needs to deal with goalkeeping issues.
_NFnX02Mumc,"just saying yeah, they let viv go. They lose to bayern. Man city winning freakin Barcelona. I'm so happy viv came to city - she deserves a quality team to support her."
_NFnX02Mumc,Does this channel wants people to start paying for Livestreme
_NFnX02Mumc,Shocking defending from the girls I have said it before and will say it again Arsenal need a top-class goalkeeper and should have persisted in their pursuit of Mary Earps.
_NFnX02Mumc,Jonas is making a talented squad look so slow and stale
_NFnX02Mumc,That was impressive!!
_NFnX02Mumc,"Arsenal coach needs to goooooooooooooooooüò¢
Am sick of all this near success syndrome."
_NFnX02Mumc,If someone has Casey Stoney's number. Give her a ring she maybe needed in the coming weeks
_NFnX02Mumc,Harder was playing against a poor Arsenal defence. Can‚Äôt keep blaming the coach and keeper. Big name  defence players look slow and play accordingly.
_NFnX02Mumc,I don‚Äôt understand why we didn‚Äôt win
_NFnX02Mumc,Embarrassing performance. To collapse like that shows a weak mentality
_NFnX02Mumc,We just need JONAS out !
_NFnX02Mumc,Leaving barca for that garbage can u just imagine wow
_NFnX02Mumc,Did arsenal decide to stop playing
_NFnX02Mumc,The amount of goals Arsenal concede from crosses is crazy.. Jonas has to go he just can't get this team to click.
_NFnX02Mumc,Some things never change
_NFnX02Mumc,"This manager is clueless letting Viv go is going to haunt you, irreplaceable talent"
_NFnX02Mumc,"It's crazy how fast people are jumping on the blame Jonas wagon & how ignorant everyone are when Arsenal is facing Germany's best Football team, you expected a walkover?. You are not in WSL anymore, you're facing the best teams in the world, so before pointing fingers, look in the mirror."
_NFnX02Mumc,"Wow what a game that was, I genuinely needed a lie down in a darkened room to get my breath back after commentating on that I was so knackered! ü§£Bayern keep up their perfect start, 7 wins in 7 this season across all competitions, and travel to Wolfsburg this weekend full of confidence. A different story for Arsenal, who most quickly turn their attention back to a massive home lunch Saturday league game against English reigning champions Chelsea. Speaking of Chelsea, it was former Blues striker who did the damage tonight, her 1st UWCL goals in almost two years and for her new club Bayern. Also I make it the first time Arsenal have conceded five in a competitive game in seven years or so! ü§Ø"
_NFnX02Mumc,3:20 What a pass from Stanway
_NFnX02Mumc,I'm not sure whether Arsenal has no goalkeeper or defence kodwa some's lacking laphaya emuva
_NFnX02Mumc,Hope arsenal play like this on Saturday
_NFnX02Mumc,once a blue always a blue üíô
_NFnX02Mumc,"Spoiler alert they showed results, it gets to me üò≠"
_NFnX02Mumc,"When Bayern meet arsenal üòÇüòÇüòÇ
You know what going to happen üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
_NFnX02Mumc,Bayern üòÇ always thrash arsenal üòÇüòÇüòÇ
_NFnX02Mumc,Why did they take off McCabe
_NFnX02Mumc,imagine not betting on this
_NFnX02Mumc,"wow, who would've thought bara bet was on point with the &quot;pernille harder show&quot; prediction... do they have a crystal ball or something? ü§î"
_NFnX02Mumc,Who's here from bara bet??
_NFnX02Mumc,crazy how no one's talking about the bara bet free picks
_NFnX02Mumc,Pernille is proper Chels üíô
_NFnX02Mumc,Be Careful What You Wish For
_NFnX02Mumc,Can we stop blaming Jonas These goals were clearing Players fault
_NFnX02Mumc,LOVELY .KEEP JONAS.WE CAN GET BACK TO CHEAP TICKETS AND BOREHAM WOOD WITH 2000 SUPPORTERS.LOVELY
_NFnX02Mumc,"The Gunners were clearly out of ammunition, they were woeful! 

How is the manager still in the job? He's useless, tactically inept!"
_NFnX02Mumc,Commentator say goals coming like London buses wait.for 1 and 2 or 3 comes üî•üíØü§£ü§£
_NFnX02Mumc,"Arsenal goalkeeper remained frozen in so many occasions. Why did they sign Daphne van Domselaar, to keep her benched?"
_NFnX02Mumc,Once again an English club robbed by cheating Germans!!
_NFnX02Mumc,"love this commentator

7:05 ""champion's league goals for pernille harder are like london buses. you wait for one and two come at once""
7:37 ""bayern are cooking here"""
_NFnX02Mumc,It was the Pernille Harder show and loved ever minute of it
_NFnX02Mumc,"Our players look so lazy, what are they doing in training?"
_NFnX02Mumc,"He changes the team almost every game,  what he is really doing üòÇ.  Sack him by tomorrow morning"
_NFnX02Mumc,He should be sacked by tomorrow morning.
_NFnX02Mumc,"Arsenal have given Jonas everything he's asked for. Players (almost all internationals), backroom staff, even the Emirates stadium for home games. Yet looking at the team you cannot identify any meaningful style of play. Strikers who are scared to shoot; no build-up; no zeal. He's had three years to put his stamp on the team but I always suspected the team was too big for him. The team needs a proper coach cos a side packed full of established internationals shldn't be struggling this badly."
_NFnX02Mumc,"Pernille makes Arsenal's life a lot ""Harder""... 
Sydney makes Arsenal go down ""loh, Mann""... ;)"
_NFnX02Mumc,"a SHAME!!!! zinsberger ""the statue"" has once again lived up to its name!!!! Actually, I never thought that Eidevall should be out, but what he's been putting on the pitch lately is subterranean!!!! Chelsea will blow us apart this weekend!!!!

eine SCHANDE!!!! zinsberger ""the statue"" hat ihrem namen mal wieder alle ehre gemacht!!!! eigentlich war ich nie der meinug dass eidevall raus sollte aber was der in letzter zeit auf den platz stellt ist unterirdisch!!!! chelsea wird uns am wochenende in der luft zerreisen!!!!"
_NFnX02Mumc,"Very disappointing result tonight ladies, far from the standards required to compete at this level. I‚Äôm sorry but Arsenal Ladies have gone backwards, we‚Äôve not started very in the WSL and this disastrous result compounds where this team is heading. Others teams in WSL have improved, but like Mikel Arteta I DO NOT ACCEPT THESE POOR STANDARDS üò°"
_NFnX02Mumc,Terrible 2nd half after a terrible result in WSL on weekend. Sorry persisting with Eidevall is ridiculous for me
_NFnX02Mumc,I think Jonas Edieval do not have the right ideas to compete at the highest level. Arsenal had no answer to the athleticism of BM ..tat's why  the Arsenal players simply could not keep up with Bayern team after a decent start.
_NFnX02Mumc,"Bayern introduced themselves into the League in 1970, although they had been playing since 1970, but the DFB would not let Women into a League from 1955 to 1970.
Bayern W did not taker themselves seriously at all and didn't really until 2011, when it was decided that, like the Men, to become the best.
Bayern W have been living in Wolfsburg's W shadow, but that has all changed over the last 2 or so Seasons.
As far as the CL goes, we have not been one of the best Teams, but that is now changing too and to trounce Arsenal as we did tonight, proves that it is.
We have come a long way in the last 13, or so years and signed some fantastic Players and I am proud of that win tonight.
Also, not lost on me, was Harder being instrumental in pulling Arsenal W apart tonight...an ex Chelsea Player :0)
Well done ladies!
Onward and upward."
_NFnX02Mumc,Joe Montemurro won the WSL title with a team decimated by injury. Jonas has put together some of the best players around. And they are getting worse.
_NFnX02Mumc,Bayern wins @ home!
_NFnX02Mumc,Arsenal men's team gonna be having flashbacks after seeing this result
_NFnX02Mumc,Eiderval doesnt know what hes doing. Zinsberger is useless

JXpEYUPFJ5w,Both Salma and Caro are the top scorers of Liga F with 20 goals.
JXpEYUPFJ5w,So great to see Mapi smiling on the pitch again!
axiUgUuaSP8,In the first goal I think Lyon made a mistake Renard should have gone to stay in front of Bonnati when she saw her running on that side to intimidate her and possibly steal the ball from her. Instead she was more to the side when Bonmati was close to the goal.
axiUgUuaSP8,Vamos Barca biggest club in the world
axiUgUuaSP8,"Barcelona finally beating Lyon and with goals from Bonmati and Putellas, a perfect story without a doubt.
Bonmati is the best player in the world for the second year, and I have no doubt that she will obtain her second Ballon d'Or not only for what she did with Barcelona but also for what she did with Spain, winning the Nations League and now the Olympic Games."
axiUgUuaSP8,"Barcelona is a team that normalizes the extraordinary. They achieved 4 titles this season when no other team, neither male nor female, could do so. 
They are writing the great history of this sport and I have no doubt that this will continue because it has the best players in the world."
axiUgUuaSP8,Aitana bonmati the best player in the world!

Sweden surely gave our Canadian women‚Äôs team a massive brain and body workout at Tokyo, and it was finally won by Canada due to PKs.  Now, we see Norway‚Äôs talent coming forth and providing even more GREAT football!

EHG-xkrgPho,"anyone think Hansen is kind of similar with Messi in the way they both play the ball, how they dribbling, passing, and looks like Hansen scores  lot of goals from outside the box. superbb"
EHG-xkrgPho,The GK for Eintract was fantastic. It could easily been 4-0
EHG-xkrgPho,Caroline Grahan Hansen is the best player in the Wolrd!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
EHG-xkrgPho,Too much quality on the Barcelona side.
EHG-xkrgPho,Paredes...1:36...very calm...keeper should have collected the ball once the chest trap had killed it
EHG-xkrgPho,WHY DID YOU NOT SHOW IT ?????????????
EHG-xkrgPho,"Not exactly a classic performance, but they got the job done. When are people going to realise that Lucy Bronze is the weak link in this team. Too often out of position, slow to track back, poor crossing, and too often giving the ball away. The sooner Rolfo returns and Batlle takes over at right back the better."

I think the coach plays her wrongly on wings even though she will still deliver. When she was moved in the middle, the goals came. Mariona is a winger also.

It‚Äôs also about human values‚Ä¶‚Äù. P√®le was highly supportive of Marta in her fight for equality. The great Bill Shankly also lived by the principles of working together, for each other and sharing the rewards. Football belongs to the people and it‚Äôs for everyone to enjoy and play.

Like dont get me wrong shes amazing however from the amount of angles Ive watched it, and the amount of times ive seen it, i think it goes over the line.

Give massive chances like that to 14 year olds, boys or girls, and they put them away nine out of ten times.

You can see on bronze-age carvings that the culture was the same..The vandals first known name was VendilaR. V√§nerns name was Vaenir(10th c.-*VendiR(until 8th c)-*Vendiz(around 0 A. D.). That means probably 'The turner', ""The tide and floodlake"". Rebecka Blomqvist and Natalie Hagman also have roots here.. You can say that the final was decided by someone with vandal connections.. VendilaR means probably ""the lesser people from V√§ner lake's cultunion.."""

dkfXiuA-RzU,"Wolfsburg needs a new 4 line of center backs that could manage games like this, besides taking out Roord out of the pitch was a bad movement, cuz she gives you calm and keep the ball close her feet‚Ä¶ the worse thing was the lack of reaction and letting Brand and Wa√ümuth in the bench since the start when they‚Äôre better than some of the 11 starter."
dkfXiuA-RzU,I like the mentality of the Barca women's team. That's so motivational and courageous. They are well deserved champions. Visca el barca‚ù§Ô∏èüíô.. forever.

R9o4rR7UmCU,"Not fair they allow a Carol clone to play on the pitch. Carol nutmegs, teleports, receive her own pass and make an assist üòÇ like ok slow down, what just happened. The best thing about this play is Aitana already casually walking back to center circle as Carol makes a pass to herself seeing into the future i'm done here, it's going to be a goal."

R9o4rR7UmCU,"Underrated play by Bonmati to leave the ball when Graham Hanson was dribbling. Had she even motioned to the ball, the whole play would have been called off for offside."

 Why the match is blocked in my country senegal"
w_J0tkPRrNk,"Liga F is a joke, there is no way a team can win a league competition getting 85 points out of 90
They need to cut the number of teams to 12 to improve quality"
w_J0tkPRrNk,"Barcelona is still great, but it was cool to see an underdog team be the ones to end a streak."
w_J0tkPRrNk,"8:17 That's a blatant foul on Barcelona player. There should be no goal for Madrid, but free kick for Barcelona."
w_J0tkPRrNk,"Barcelona must be signed Ichika Egashira from Excursionistas , Argentina ."
w_J0tkPRrNk,"Pathetic game. At this rate, wolfsburg will thrash us."
w_J0tkPRrNk,23 months of unbeaten run and finally to get beaten by two goals from the same player. An African. This with Alexia also in the team. wow
w_J0tkPRrNk,Talk about bad timing... A draw and a loss just before UWCL final... But I know they'll bounce back !! For√ßa Bar√ßa ‚ô•Ô∏èüíô
w_J0tkPRrNk,Ghosts are back. Wolfsburg will kick you
w_J0tkPRrNk,Not to take credit away from Madrid CFF but I'll never understand why they have the party bus parade while the season is still going on. The men's team also lost because of this. And Barca Femeni still have things to play for with CL final coming up. Have the parade when all the games have finished
w_J0tkPRrNk,"Extending your unbeaten run is a lower priority than CL title. Gather yourselves, Barca. Let's GO!"
w_J0tkPRrNk,"complacent attitude !! they just thought they would win as usual...their whole game lacked any spark...as a Barca fan, i'm glad they lost, MCFF deserved their win..time to face reality...Oshola, Salma, Geyse, Lopez are NOT top flight goal scorers.......geyse refuses to pass, lopez is all over the place, salma buzzes around like a bee but with little effect, and Oshoala just stands rigid waiting for the ball to come to her......barca should have quickly snagged Katoto and diani from psg before they re-signed again for psg"
w_J0tkPRrNk,THERE'S ALWAYS A TIME COMES WHEN SOMEONE COMES ALONG AND BEATS YOU
w_J0tkPRrNk,Barca picked the worst possible time to be in poor form. Wolfsburg are gonna be a real challenge in the UWCL final

CxbFu9EQbNk,Patri instead of walti
CxbFu9EQbNk,"I'm no Chelsea supporter, but you're not telling me that not even a single one of their players deserved to appear in the team of the semi-finals. I actually support Man United, but the amount of antipathy towards Chelsea is quite astounding. I mean, Guru Reiten scored an equaliser in the second leg against Barca and was really excellent, but she is entirely omitted. That's just for a start. 

There are some players on this list who made significant mistakes over the course of the two legs, so that can't be the reason why not one Chelsea player is included. Arsenal did not go through, just like Chelsea, but they have 3 players on the list, so that can't be the reason either. Did you just forget about Chelsea? It's not like every player performed terribly over 2 legs for them, so they don't deserve a spot. I don't like unfairness and I think there should at least have been one Chelsea player in this list. At the end of the day they made it all the way to the semi-final and it was not exactly an easy set of games for Barcelona in the end, but here it is like they have been written out of the history of this season. Disappointing. 

If Man U make it through to Europe and the group stages next year (fingers crossed), I hope they are treated with more respect."
CxbFu9EQbNk,"Perfect 11 üî• also funny that from 4 semi-finalists, you chose not to pick from Chelsea"

i6pWMu8GOTI,Fair win for Wolfsburg arsenal played rlly not bad but in the first game the 2:2 wasn't fair because one arsenal lady don't get red for a real red card and thats Feeling like Arsenal bought the ref because the ref had 5 false times in so normal Situations and i thounk arsenal bought the ref but the back game was excited and Arsenal played fair and in the end it was a rlly excited half final of the women Champions-League
i6pWMu8GOTI,"Hey !!! Dear coaches and managers !!! 

Please forget about everything they show you in UEFA Pro Licence courses and stop asking your goalkeepers to make short passes to the teammates on the sides. Just kick that bloody ball long please when you are under pressure and outnumbered by the opponents üòéüëç"
i6pWMu8GOTI,Again VAR kills us ..same as to The Boys in the EPL...
i6pWMu8GOTI,"Gooner bottled again ü§£ 
Well played Wolfsburg üí™"
i6pWMu8GOTI,Playing out from the back at 118 minutes is naive in the extreme.
i6pWMu8GOTI,A rampart Barcelona women's side.. I hope Wolfsburg women win the UCL
i6pWMu8GOTI,Arsenal man or woman teams . Doesn't matter üòÇ.  They always in the end losing üòÇ
i6pWMu8GOTI,I love that woman‚Äôs soccer is getting more attention.
i6pWMu8GOTI,"It‚Äôs crazy that I was actually thinking about the aftermath of the same move after the Wolfsburg player recovered the ball when it hit the crossbar at 115‚Äô, only for it to happen 3mns later üòÇ"
i6pWMu8GOTI,What an absolute gift we gave them
i6pWMu8GOTI,no.23 of wolfsburg is cute
i6pWMu8GOTI,Men‚Äôs football in slow motion üòÄ
i6pWMu8GOTI,It's seems women football players have better shooting accuracy than their men counterparts this days
i6pWMu8GOTI,An error lead to vfl wolfsburg victory however both team deserve to be in The Final üòäüòä
i6pWMu8GOTI,"what an amazing match ,congratulations for both  teams, wondeful."
i6pWMu8GOTI,"Well done the Shewolves.  That was one of the best games ever. They did the record crowd proud. Can‚Äôt wait for next season, come on Arsenal!"
i6pWMu8GOTI,arsenal repeated same mistake they did on frst game
i6pWMu8GOTI,What a game!
i6pWMu8GOTI,Wolfsburg player to avoid the floor challenge (Impossible)
i6pWMu8GOTI,Arsenal football club is cursed..bottled jobs
i6pWMu8GOTI,FINAAAAALE üíö
i6pWMu8GOTI,No allegiance to either team but that was great to watch!!
i6pWMu8GOTI,That's going to hurt Arsenal ladies for a while.....critical error and they got punished. All the best Wolfsburg against the mighty Barcelona!
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Yo England, has it come home yet? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
9Loh1C-GRHs,LOL @1:44 you can see blackstenius offside further ahead of Woldsburg #6 but hey she got away with it here. @6:56 Jen Beattie totally just runs over the Wolfsburg player couldnt see # but hilarious. Well earned win by Wolfsburg unfortunately it's clear Arsenal suppose star power didn't show up to the game. LOL

9Loh1C-GRHs,"The last goal, so Sunday league."
9Loh1C-GRHs,The arsenal girls have more balls than the men's team
9Loh1C-GRHs,Who is the co-commentating woman?
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal doing Arsenal things. Giving a cheap goal at the most crucial time. Same mistakes that the mens team does
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Imagine repeating same mistake against same opponent in 2 legs. Like you don't have the players to play from the back bro, kick the goal kick up and let everyone move."
9Loh1C-GRHs,Bottle jobs. Just like the men.
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Arsenal men/women seem cursed. They start strong, get our hope high sky and then let us on free fall without anything to hold on to."
9Loh1C-GRHs,not one English womens player in that arsenal team. got what they deservedüòÇ
9Loh1C-GRHs,What happened to Huthüòµ‚Äçüí´
9Loh1C-GRHs,I really have to give Credit to both teams. Such high intensity from both teams especially Arsenal. They fought so hard although they made some little error in defending
9Loh1C-GRHs,voice of female commentator like Louis Armstrong https://youtu.be/VqhCQZaH4Vs?t=32
9Loh1C-GRHs,What a craze game üëè
9Loh1C-GRHs,Revenge of Uero  England Vs Germany final üòÇ
9Loh1C-GRHs,Sometimes you just have to hit the ref
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal is used to bottling up
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal gave away two goals bc of defense mistakes in both games. Sad.
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Color commentator knows only one adjective ‚Äî ""brilliant"" -- and only one adverb -- ""absolutely."" Listening to the whole match was painful."
9Loh1C-GRHs,Wolfsburg were clearly the better side
9Loh1C-GRHs,"That was a clear pen for wolfsburg, the incompetent ref bottled a clear intentional handballüòÆ"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Post match celebration:

https://youtu.be/MAcSv6kXJRg"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Would have liked to see McCabe's ball  hitting the post in the highlights too, could have been such a beautiful goal"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Hey !!! Dear coaches and managers !!! 

Please forget about everything they show you in UEFA Pro Licence courses and stop asking your goalkeepers to make short passes to the teammates on the sides. Just kick that bloody ball long please when you are under pressure and outnumbered by the opponents üòéüëç"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Classic arsenal to make a mistake at the back all by themselves to throw the game away
9Loh1C-GRHs,"What a bad defending ,  Wihtout Leah this defence is nothing"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Germans beating the English! Love it!
9Loh1C-GRHs,right  back must pay for her sins

9Loh1C-GRHs,Valiant effort from Arsenal ‚ù§Ô∏è really proud of how they fought till the v end with the number of injuries they have!!
9Loh1C-GRHs,Still no idea why those goals were ruled out as offside

9Loh1C-GRHs,"Taking Blacksteinus off was not a great decision imo. She was speedy, on her game and always going for it. Did she pick up an injury we don't know about?"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Jonsdottir is an amazing player! A deserved win for Wolfsburg!
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Best move was Brand's pass to Bremer. It was a copy of the 2:1 by Germany against the USA in 2022, when Brand passed to Krumbiegel."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Arsenal were well beaten on their own turf too? The score flattered Arsenal, it could so easily been 2 - 6 to Wolfsburg, superb play from the Germans. Well deserved?"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"""it's a calamitous there..."" This commentator is such a liability."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Great game, the fighting spirit in both."
9Loh1C-GRHs,I'm very proud of this girls. Up Gunners 4 life
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal womenü§ù arsenal men. Bottle both ucl and prem peak times for their fans

9Loh1C-GRHs,Great game.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Man Utd will come and wipe their tears next season ‚ù§
9Loh1C-GRHs,Was Blackstenius called off side by VAR for her disallowed goal in the 47th minute? Looked legit to me
9Loh1C-GRHs,Disappointing  ... the Arsenal defenders didn't seem to full commit & put everything on the line  ... here & there at least .. Arsenal could have won this ...
9Loh1C-GRHs,Jonsdottir is an absolute unit!
9Loh1C-GRHs,I am glad arsenal lost bias female commentator the ref tried to help then non stop all game because how was that not a penalty and how was arsenal first goal in d build up not a foul overhyped English teams
9Loh1C-GRHs,keystone cops defending at the end
9Loh1C-GRHs,same arsenal every where
9Loh1C-GRHs,"I feel for arsenal players üò¢, even in first leg in Germany they gave away same kind of goal.
The coach needs to change it bcz playing from the back need experience players who're quick or they need to learn the time of releasing such ball in terms of danger."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"I'm so happy that Wolfsburg won. And the only reason is because the commentary team especially the lady who is commentating was so biased! Every time Arsenal won a tackle or something age was saying well done, well done. But nothing for Wolfsburg. Pathetic! 

8:52 the silence was deafening from her here üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Why does Arsenal have a keeper ? 
And the ball watching at the end was criminal. Wooflsberg robbed of a pen though"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"I cannot believe we, the Arsenal lost because of a blunder"
9Loh1C-GRHs,I really love women's football. Thanks for all these videos. I also suggest those https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppELWXqck-8&list=PLoMQcSDeHlC1A-v6_a2yzP8ngC56xZ_HI
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal fans can‚Äôt seem to catch a break üòÇ
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal bottled again xD
9Loh1C-GRHs,No love lost between those two teams. That cheap shot against Popp after the second Arsenal goal was very rough.
9Loh1C-GRHs,This looks like child playing
9Loh1C-GRHs,That's a penalty all day. Learn to keep your hands down
9Loh1C-GRHs,"There must have been thousands of children asleep during the extra time . Poor things . The early kick off didn't work . Plus all the ice cream they would have eaten too ..
Are the tickets for Tuesday nights game costing the same as the mummies and kids paid ?? Practically nothing üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. A hamburger would cost more than their admission . Yet , the attendance is highlighted as often as possible . 
Delighted that Arsenal were beaten , by the way . ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£"

9Loh1C-GRHs,Better Chelsea women
9Loh1C-GRHs,"I'm waiting for the day when both women and men, will play football in the same team and end millennia of discrimination  against women."
9Loh1C-GRHs,Fair play to the 60063 fans who went üëè but Lotte wuben moy.. deary me! What were you thinking?! üôà 1 minute to go and you do that! üò¨ silly sausage
9Loh1C-GRHs,Itz de iztory of the assna.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Why was the second Blackstemius goal disallowed?  When B punched it in the net she was behind the girl when the ball was crossed.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Christ even the Arsenal women have the same brittle mentality as the men
9Loh1C-GRHs,"I love Arsenal, but the UEFA Champions League Cup belongs in EUROPE, not in the UK.
Barca will be hard to beat, but this will be a fabulous Final."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"They play out from the back just like the men,  Useless."
9Loh1C-GRHs,English teams doesn't know how to play in CL.
9Loh1C-GRHs,"just like the men they're failures
9:55"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"What a shame that one of the English teams could not make the final ,think Wolfsberg will give Barca a game ."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"That was actually a penalty.

Her hand was in an unnatural position and was used to intercept the ball!

The ref is probably too jittery to do her job!"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Why arsenal thier men and women make same mistakes
9Loh1C-GRHs,lol imagine walking with the ball with your head down into the opponent with 2 mins left
9Loh1C-GRHs,Great coming Arsenal you need  to make deference Sorry for injury of Wienbor because of lionesses I'm ur side
9Loh1C-GRHs,Tbh Barca would destroy either of these teams
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal is the bottler fc.
9Loh1C-GRHs,2nd leg Wolfsburg was improved. However still easily loosing the ball. 23 was selfish. Shld start Brand regularly
9Loh1C-GRHs,"London is Blues, only Chelsea reach the Champions League final"
9Loh1C-GRHs,1:15 How was this not a penalty?
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal would have played worse honestly if they were healthy lol
9Loh1C-GRHs,Terrible to watch
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal and set pieces are made for me each other.. be it men or women üòÇüòÇüòÇ
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Both male and female, our set piece defending av been poor dis season"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Not being sexist or anything but jesus christ it's like watching 12 year olds play, people who think this is the same level as the men's game need their head checking"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"What a game ! Both teams were just amazing üëå
Congrats ladies üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè"
9Loh1C-GRHs,I just hope they don't let transgender woman to play or join competition or clubs. I am starting to enjoy this.
9Loh1C-GRHs,"When Huth missed that chance to put the game away mid-2nd half, I had an ominous feeling. Great that Frohms had that super-save in extra time and it didn't eventually get to penalties"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Chin up, Arsenal ladies! What a fight you put on in both legs of this tie!"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Arsenal seems to always bottle it all in the last minute, this was just a simple pass to her team mate or kick a long ball inside, i just don't know what she was thinking lol"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"What a great match. Suspenseful, punches exchanged all game long."
9Loh1C-GRHs,üòîüòîüòîüòîvery dissappointed 4 this result..but Arsenal showed best performance until semifinal...comeback strongers gooners...‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§from meüá≤üá®üá≤üá®üá≤üá®üá≤üá®üá≤üá®
9Loh1C-GRHs,why arsenal subbed Blackstenius and Jule Brand Ballon d'or
9Loh1C-GRHs,That was a penalty handball
9Loh1C-GRHs,Lol Arsenal female and male teams being the Arsenal we all know.
9Loh1C-GRHs,"I was rooting for arsenal, I thought they were more lucky than the Chelsea ladies whom where paired with both Lyon and Barcelona. Now the both england clubs are out. The question is, will arsenal even make an appearance in the next year's champions league competition. From what we see on the WSL table, man UTD, man city and cfc are really up there ahead of arsenal."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Not sure what the ref is having for breakfast tomorrow,  no doubt she will check with VAR. Very poor officiating at times"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Whoever VAR was shouldn't be in the sport.. no idea absolute  Muppet!
9Loh1C-GRHs,Barca's fans want against Arsenal in the final matchüò¢
9Loh1C-GRHs,How was that not a penüòÇ was the clearest hand ball i‚Äôve ever seen
9Loh1C-GRHs,These girls seem better than US women. Better pay attention USA.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Congratulations Wolfsburg üéâ
9Loh1C-GRHs,"I think the right result.Wolfsburg should of had a pen in the first half,VAR joke.I've seen loads given for handball in the EPL for less than that."
9Loh1C-GRHs,arsenal skipped sportsmanship. well deserved loss
9Loh1C-GRHs,They just summed up in 120 minutes what their men's team did throughout the season.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal women is no different from the men lol
9Loh1C-GRHs,How‚Äôs the red not gave that penalty for handball for Wolfsburg? They wanted Arsenal to win so bad! Pathetic
9Loh1C-GRHs,Its amazing match. After few years women football will grow huge.
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Fancy Wolfsburg (what a fabulous name too, City of Wolves!!) but really feel for Arsenal fans after managing to pack the Emirates. Would have been the best final between the two strongest clubs in terms of following, let alone football quality. And achtung Leute, our Alexia is back! ;)"
9Loh1C-GRHs,nothing new arsenal giving others chanceüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
9Loh1C-GRHs,What was that arsenal lady doing. Clear the ball and it's on for penalties. Hope they come back strong next season
9Loh1C-GRHs,Barca women will tear them apart
9Loh1C-GRHs,JULE BRAND is my new favorite player. The runs she made were game-changing and that classy play she made got them the winner.  Amazing energy and movement!
9Loh1C-GRHs,Barca has to be scared now.
9Loh1C-GRHs,AssNal bottled üçº it again üòÖ
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Wolfsburg, thanks for eleminating an english team. Great jobüëãüëã"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"crazy game...Wolfsburg should have scored and closed out in the 69.min...was there not an offside position at the second Arsenal goal (7:10)? anyways, vs Barca I am routing for the she-wolves ;-)"
9Loh1C-GRHs,This dumb women trying skill someone up on edge of her box in 118s minute üò°üò°üò°
9Loh1C-GRHs,That was great struggle. Congrats Wolfsburg.
9Loh1C-GRHs,But always the referees decide for the island....unbelievable....
9Loh1C-GRHs,I've never seen a women's match where there wasn't a mistake at the back resulting in a goal. Just clear the ball!!!
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Playing out from the back with 2 minutes of extra time to go ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Great effort though, should be proud. A fully fit team would of won that."
9Loh1C-GRHs,We didn't see the line offside goal
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Arsenal bottled it in Europe, a week after bottling the league in both men & women's football."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Pass it or boot it out ffs! When your ego outweighs your talent, this is what happens, Rookie mistake.ü§£"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Like I said,  an English team will not be getting a UCL  title this year."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Great match! Unfortunate that yet another football match decided by an opponent taking the ball away from a defender in closing minutes of a game! 
It doesn‚Äôt seem to matter wether it is men‚Äôs or women‚Äôs leagues, pros or others, instead of keeper clearing the ball far into opponents half, the ball is passed around by the back line and taken away!! Give the forwards a chance to decide outcome, not the tired defenders!
Nevertheless congrats Wolfsburg! The final should be entertaining"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Bottled it like the men have with the league üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
9Loh1C-GRHs,Not the time to play out from the back. Tired legs got the better of Arsenal
9Loh1C-GRHs,Nahh the victory screech?? We need that
9Loh1C-GRHs,That's just a horrendous mistake to make in the 118th minute.
9Loh1C-GRHs,why so long
9Loh1C-GRHs,"I was there at the stadium watching this 60,063 people where there it was crazy"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"To make it this far with all the injuries the Arsenal ladies first team have is an achievement in itself. In fact, Eidevall was about to pull a Champions League miracle. Well in ladies. And the RB should hold her head high! She was brave. Many players hide from such a pass esp in the last minute of a big game. She got it controlled perfectly with utmost composure, and even wanted to beat her opponent. In a champions league semi, that's brave!! Keep going girl even the best fall sometimes but they are the best because they learn from failure and keep moving!! COYG!! You made us proud!! Bless üî¥‚ö™üî¥‚ö™"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Perfect! English teams out of Europe again ü§™
9Loh1C-GRHs,Lol why wasn‚Äòt that first goal from Arsenal called back? Clear foul from Arsenal in their half before scoring the goal. Video didn‚Äòt show the VAR decision.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Lol Catley 6:32
9Loh1C-GRHs,I would rather Wolfsburg win it on spot kicks.  Sometimes luck a is a cruel mistress but I am sure Lotte Wuben Moy is made of sterner stuff she would be back stronger.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Wobenmoye! Gifted Wolfsburg the final and possibly the cup.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Very nice game. Wolfsburg is the best üü¢üî•
9Loh1C-GRHs,Wolfberg will win it
9Loh1C-GRHs,England were lucky when Popp got injured during Euro 2022 final warm up she would have won it for Germany if she was fit.
9Loh1C-GRHs,"commentators are biased, they only support Arsenal"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Really well played from both teams ; some decisions didn't go arsenal's way though as they had 2 goals disallowed but we'll played from wolfsburg. Really great effort from arsenal but unlucky
9Loh1C-GRHs,What the referee
9Loh1C-GRHs,"So sad that English pundits won't be seeing an all English final, not even one English team 

Nevertheless I rooted for Arsenal even tho I'm not an Arsenal fan. Gotta love their fighting spirits despite heavy injury crisis"
9Loh1C-GRHs,What a match üî•ü•∞üá¨üá≠
9Loh1C-GRHs,Merle has to get credit for them world class saves she made üí™
9Loh1C-GRHs,I just watched the highlights from the first leg. What's up with Arsenal's defense? They seemed kind of too laxed and not quite coordinated. That last goal was just given away.
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Heartbreaking, but so proud of these women. No Mead, Miedema,  Little, Ford, or Williamson - that's half the first choice team - but over the two legs, they made Wolfsberg (arguably the second best team in Europe) look ordinary. BUT,  they really do need to stop this fetish of playing out from back, when it suicidally invites pressure and consequent mistakes."
9Loh1C-GRHs,Blacksteinus playing along side Beth Mead and Miedema will be the strongest attacking trio coke next year. üî•
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Who was offside in the buildup on Blackstenius' disallowed goal, or was it something else? Can't see from the camera angle on the video and they didn't show what VAR saw."
9Loh1C-GRHs,I hope Wiegman drops Wubben-Moy from the England squad after this game. First a handball then a howler in the last 3 minutes ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9Loh1C-GRHs,Disgraceful mistake for the 3rd wolfsburg goal. Female Rob Holding
9Loh1C-GRHs,what an exciting game
9Loh1C-GRHs,cant spell arsenal without L
9Loh1C-GRHs,"The girls did all we could've asked of them and then some. Eventually, it was just too much with all those injuries. The difference, in the end, was that the Germans, unlike us, had their biggest star back - Popp was vital with assisting the first and scoring the second.
We need to learn to finish the games though. Those two goals conceded in overtime against United, the late equaliser by Kerr against Chelsea, and now this. Season defining moments."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Brand came too late and Oberdorf does not look fit enough. Luck in the end, but these 2 aspects should be respected next time."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Hendrich (Nr.4) from Wolfsburg had today a nightmare day‚Ä¶ not just by the first goal, but the whole game.., I don‚Äôt understand the coach, why he didn‚Äôt took her off‚Ä¶ Wolfsburg was very lucky, that her mistakes were not really used by Arsenal‚Ä¶ on the end, Wolfsburg won the game‚Ä¶ but she (Hendrich) played on a amateur league game level today‚Ä¶"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"You wouldn't believe how many mistakes are made, in trying to clear the ball out from the goal area, between the GKs, and their defensive players close to them. This avenue for potential errors must be investigated and shut down. This is mostly in the women's game, where the GKS do not have a forceful enough kicking ability to get the ball out of harm's way, asap."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Can't help but root for Arsenal given the season they had, but Wolfsburg deserved the win with this performance so fair play to them
Barca is probably going to run riot in the final anyway though"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Jule Brand was the Gamechanger üíöüíöüíö
9Loh1C-GRHs,"WHY, WHY, WHY do coaches preach this passing it around at the back nonsense, ""building from the back"" as they call it? And if coaches MUST persist with this mind-numbing tactic can't they coach teams to forget it when there are 3 minutes left and to just get the ball as far from their own goal as possible? Wolfsburg's winner goes down in my book as an own goal by the coaches and the fullback who tried to dribble the ball past an opponent in her own third of the pitch! Absolute suicide tactics which must cause fans to have heart attacks several times in a game when defenders get caught out by the simple tactic of pressing. Aaaaaaargh!"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Can't win a champions league semifinal if you make easy mistakes like that in both games. Why do they insist on playing out from the back when it never helps them and just gives the opponents easy goals? Is eidevall that stubborn or are the players just unskilled?
9Loh1C-GRHs,I wonder how many arsenal fans has been sent to the hospital because of this near success feat that our men women and youths had pulled this season. (well i'm glad for the cup the women won thi season). Well done hope we do well enough to win it next season. COYG. Great performance from our women's team.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Congrats to Wolfsburg
9Loh1C-GRHs,Barcelona >>> both
9Loh1C-GRHs,"It was so so close, I'm so sad and angry"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal and Wolfsburg didn't take their chances. Arsenal especially didn't in extra time. Gg

ET86gczHcrI,"What a fantastic game and a what great advertisement for  Womens football! since Euro 22 it been a big thing for me personally and have had the privilege of watching die frauen mannschaft live against France and Sweden.

This was a game that had it all and it was end to end action and for me it was pleasing to see wolfsburg progress to the final.

Jule Brand  was the difference in the end between Arsenal and Wolfsburg she was simply the super sub who made things happen and her unselfish play shined through yet again!

Jule you truly are the Golden girl of football!   I'm looking forward to the final hope I get ticket for Eindioven!

Wptmpw2ivJU,lets go forward  1 year.. Aitana destroying Chelsea again‚Ä¶ same score 2-1 .. Aitana chelsea nightmare ‚ù§‚ù§üòÇ
Wptmpw2ivJU,"The talent on Barcelona's team is mind-blowing, just incredible. It's hard to even rank  the players because they're all great.  Take Aitana, Paruello, Mapi Leon, Mariona, Oshoala, Marta Torrej√≥n and Irene Paredes and put them on another team and you instantly have a top two team in the world and Barcelona still keeps its number one status with Alexia, Pina, Graham, Bronze, Fridolina Rolf√∂,  Pa√±os, Ingrid Syrstad Engen, Esmee Brugts and Keira Walsh"
Wptmpw2ivJU,Chelsea
Wptmpw2ivJU,Chelsea is too much back passing.. move forward
Wptmpw2ivJU,"Sam Kerr big big big mistake.Without her Chelsea wud have won.Sam Kerr look at her games at elite level,defenders must be delighted to see her"
Wptmpw2ivJU,Look pan the amount of fouls that are happening rite in front of the referee and she is not calling them am a referee myself and a foul is a foul she is not well focus in this game
Wptmpw2ivJU,The referee is not fare in this game she made some mistakes in the game
Wptmpw2ivJU,"BARCA WERE NOT THAT FANTASTIC,,ONLY SCORED 1 GOAL"
Wptmpw2ivJU,Last play of the game and she didn‚Äôt fking cross it ffs that‚Äôs Chelsea fc in a nutshell this season
Wptmpw2ivJU,I supported the Barcelona win but Chelsea have proven me wrong. They did their best and improved. Nice oneüëç
Wptmpw2ivJU,‚ù§‚ù§Chelsea
Wptmpw2ivJU,Keira will play her first ever wucl final

suiRCBzlS1k,‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§waoo Barse Lona my fevraute team...
suiRCBzlS1k,Those English commentators are need to be banned cause they live under British Hypocrisy
suiRCBzlS1k,"English commentator are really trash, they are to biased. Barca deserve better commentator who respect them tho"
suiRCBzlS1k,what a game <3
suiRCBzlS1k,Who was able to hold on?üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
suiRCBzlS1k,Boring final now.
suiRCBzlS1k,Thank you for this channel üëèüëèüëè
suiRCBzlS1k,Camp mou the football cathedral
suiRCBzlS1k,I said it so often SamKerr big problem at elite level.Look at the recent preformances she was hopeless granted unable to get the feed.Its to easy to nullify her ability to contribute.Nobody see's cause the name is psycholigally ingrain like ronaldo latter time at utd.
suiRCBzlS1k,"YO PENSABA QUE: GIL MANZANO, MATHEU LAOZ, DEL CERRO GRANDE, HERN√ÅNDEZ HERN√ÅNDEZ ERAN MALOS ARBITROS HASTA QUE VI CUANTOS FUERA DE JUEGO INEXISTENTES NOS PITAN EN EL F√öTBOL FEMENINO...."
suiRCBzlS1k,Justice was done chealsea out for cheating last match Lauren James the man had dived hahaaaaaaa
suiRCBzlS1k,"Emma Hayes tactics were so boring, Chelsea had zero shot on target for 63 mins, and you called it well played."
suiRCBzlS1k,"Chelsea doesn't have uwcl mentality like other teams, I would say Arsenal is competing in much better way than Chelsea"
suiRCBzlS1k,This dazn commentators are from England and they always praise wsl teams. 2years before Chelsea were favourites and today they are like Chelsea fought hard. Double standards
suiRCBzlS1k,Raise you hand if you hate Barcelona ‚úã
suiRCBzlS1k,"Once more, Emma Hayes fails to send Chelsea in European Championship final. I know she is an idol for Chelsea fans but..."
suiRCBzlS1k,"This Chelsea is not the one i know üòèüòèüòèüòè
They cant even complete 3 vital passes üôÑüôÑüôÑ 
what os really happening .... abi dem swear for unaa. Erriskson should be sold ASAP!!! 
Todd Boehly release money to Emma Hayes cos they really need more players ."
suiRCBzlS1k,Thanks Bar√ßa!! The cheaters are out!!
suiRCBzlS1k,"once again great coverage & Barca looked magnificent & once Alexia is back in the team they'll look even better, BUT & i don't know why, i have a gut feeling that they wont win the trophy, don't know why just a feeling"
suiRCBzlS1k,Chelsea played so well
suiRCBzlS1k,"It was a fantastic game! So admirable performance! It was a final practically... pure electricity for each of their shooting... Giru's is great player... and Graham... pfff! Diamonds... Big duels between Geyse and Carter, Mjelde, Cuthbert Mariona... everyone... Keer's Assistances...  but Aitana... what a midfielder...  Resume 1:32:23 Graham... 1:35:53 Giru..."
suiRCBzlS1k,"This is just mediocrity from jona instead of finishing Chelsea in first half he choose to just hang in and won by small margin, i hope we get a better coach"
suiRCBzlS1k,"Play time 32.19...Chelsea (and Arsenal's) favorite move... a nod to the GK, she pretends she in pain, the rest of the team go for a coaching session with Emma Hayes (ipad already in  hand) ...THIS MUST STOP...failing that make it like American football, stop every 10 mins for a coaching...its a miracle that the second emma hayes finishes, the GK recovers as if by miracle !!!!!!! its become endemic in WSL...STOP IT NOW.....and i love how one of the physio's attending berger keeps looking back to emma hayes for her nod of ok !!!!"
suiRCBzlS1k,This Bar√ßa Femen√≠ team has got more ü•öü•öü•ö than their male counterparts.
suiRCBzlS1k,#CarolineGrahamBrilliat10üíô‚ù§
suiRCBzlS1k,"Bravo Barcelona, scored and had many more chances! How do Chelsea expect to win if Kerr made her debut in the attack on the 55th minute?!"
suiRCBzlS1k,What's wrong with the commentators always talking down on Barcelona? Or is it that they support Chelsea
suiRCBzlS1k,"Berger likes to act like she has a bad knee at least once a game, the simulation is abused in this team"
suiRCBzlS1k,Great games
suiRCBzlS1k,"Very proud of the way the girls battled today , not quite enough on the night ."
suiRCBzlS1k,I'm watching this in Spanish because I can't stand listening to Lianne Sanderson!
suiRCBzlS1k,The Barca coach‚Äôs mind was just to qualify but not to win by a huge margin looking at today‚Äôs selection and tactics
suiRCBzlS1k,One step away to win this tournament. Putella will be back in the final can't wait to see her brilliant performance once again
suiRCBzlS1k,"1 : 1
Barca won on aggregate.
Congratulations to all the players, hope to see you at WC 2023 in Oceania (NZ + AUS)."
suiRCBzlS1k,What's the final score ?
suiRCBzlS1k,It‚Äôs a pity my Chelsea couldn‚Äôt make it.
suiRCBzlS1k,VARcelona ü§° paying ref as usual can't even beat Chelsea at camp Nou

gjVNGIS_izY,"Coaches like Jonas E need to get off their pretentious high horse and go and ask Chelsea's Emma Hayes for advice and commit money to assist in their knowledge as he seems to be fine with decimating national teams of their players to acl injuries and other injuries. The stats this season alone of how many players Arsenal hasn't given enough to prevent these severe injuries whereas Chelsea has prevented acl injuries, yet at the same time, Chelsea has so many other injuries. So where is FIFA, each national team associations, the league or club associations and tournament sponsorship giving more to support the players. By supporting the players to get the data and prevention skills, they support women's soccer/football and all together women's sports. And not just for professional leagues or national teams, this information needs to given to semi-pro, minor and house leagues so kids and coaches get the information to learn to treat their bodies and minds appropriately without having to take all the expensive courses and workshops. Put the information online for free access on the very basics so that it is available instead of hoarded and secretive as a competitive edge."
gjVNGIS_izY,Chelsea vs Arsenal ! . . . Hopefully !
gjVNGIS_izY,English pundits cant stand Walsh being on the bench. She is the most obvious option to be benched if Alexia is backüòÇ
gjVNGIS_izY,"I have to say it's really nice to see this be so tight between these teams compared to last year, makes for a much less predictable race to the finish. And I can understand why none of these analysts are really giving Wolfsburg much of a chance there, especially when they can often struggle in away games on hostile grounds (Juventus, anyone?) which the Arsenal home ground absolutely will be. But nobody could've predicted that the Gunners would just hand over the 2 easiest goals Wolfsburg ever got on a silver platter either (or then make up for it!) so who knows. Doesn't really matter either way since nobody will stop Barca from grabbing the cup at the end anyway."
gjVNGIS_izY,It‚Äôs all to play for in the second legs. I‚Äôm nervous excited x
gjVNGIS_izY,How pathetic one pundit suggest Bonmati should be the one to come out for Alexia to come in all because Walsh played well forgetting Patri plays even better in the DM roleüòÖ
gjVNGIS_izY,"Liane Sanderson could sing like Louis Armstrong 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqhCQZaH4Vs"
gjVNGIS_izY,ARSENAL and Barcelona
gjVNGIS_izY,Two epic games
gjVNGIS_izY,ARSENAL WILL BE THERE
gjVNGIS_izY,I wanted to be Barca vs Wolfsburg but Barca & Arsenal are very hot this year.
gjVNGIS_izY,"James has mad ball control, but is utterly inconsistent, and can't defend. Very hard to justify her starting. Chelsea is really missing Kirby. Going forward Chelsea has real challenges with its backline. No combination has been solid this season. Perisset is still undercooked in the roll, Buchanan hasn't gelled, and Bright although adored by Chelsea and British fans alike is getting slower and slower. Chelsea needs an attacking right back like Bronze, Carpenter or Catley."
gjVNGIS_izY,I hope Arsenal make it
gjVNGIS_izY,I love Barca woman
gjVNGIS_izY,I need Wolfsburg vs Arsenal last week full match please Admin
gjVNGIS_izY,"Speaking about freak shows (in the nicest possible way): nice ""balance"" to the commentary team.
(Wonder if our host got around to actually watching the games?)
By the way, Graham-Hanson's left foot is her bad foot so Chelski's defense did well.
On the other foot, Rolfo likes it on her left; speak to Arsenal about what she can do with her right.
My hope is for Wolfsburg in the final --
who wants to hear injury excuses for the end of time as to why Barca creamed Arsenal (again) in the 2023 Final --
unfortunately Wolfsburg probably lost their chance at home."
gjVNGIS_izY,My prediction: FC Bar√ßalona - Arsenal WFC

xbQRflXw9E8,Though it's been years i still come for this video ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
xbQRflXw9E8,"A year and a couple of months after this game happened. I can confirm that it has changed how the women‚Äôs game has evolved. 
Playing with a fully packed stadium has become the norm. 
I was there to witness history and now i feel like the ticket i bought was worth so much more than what i bought it for. Truly and incredible feeling to contribute to history and to one day share this with my children in the future!"
xbQRflXw9E8,I really appreciate the DAZN UWCL coverage
xbQRflXw9E8,Barcelona soccer teams never disappointed their fansüèÜ.üëçüëçüëç
xbQRflXw9E8,Man that was emotional üò¢
xbQRflXw9E8,I t makes me happy to see people support women's soccer and barcelona is an extraordinary team. I do think in Catalunya soccer is a symbol of Catalan pride and that helped I believe get so many supporters to the stadium.
xbQRflXw9E8,"‚Äúthey chant alexia the way they chant for messi‚Äù, ive seen this documental so many times and that phrase naves fails to make me cry. women‚Äôs football came to stay"
xbQRflXw9E8,"The record was set in 1971 in Mexico City 120.000. World Cup Final Mexico - Denmark 0-3. But FIFA tried to hide it. Countries were forced to stop writing about it, just watch the documentary ""Copa 71"" Still this is a big step for womens soccer."
xbQRflXw9E8,Kudos to Barcelona and it's fans for making this huge. Truly Barcelona is taking the women's football to another level. Marketing is also important and key... New Stadium will make things much more grande.
xbQRflXw9E8,Changed football so much that nobody heard of it.
xbQRflXw9E8,Brilliant Watch I not a fan of the men‚Äôs team for my own reasons but love The women‚Äôs team and been using quite a lot of their players on EAFC
xbQRflXw9E8,"The impact this match had on the world of women‚Äôs football is undeniable. All of you girls out there in the fields and the crowds, you have done us proud."
xbQRflXw9E8,The women's game is here to stay and I am so proud of all that the women have achieved over the years. You go girls!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüí•üëçüèΩ
xbQRflXw9E8,Barcelona is really heart of football. No any club has contributed to sports as much as barca
xbQRflXw9E8,4:20 sent chills down my spine.
xbQRflXw9E8,Alexia taking a sweeping bow to the crowd didn't go off well. It is not just about one person but the whole team which gets you there. She smacked of arrogance
xbQRflXw9E8,It was great to see so much people attend. I hope more of those feminist go out and support women football. Keep it up women in football proud of you all.
xbQRflXw9E8,"Zornoza is a beast. Beware! 
HALA MADRID"
xbQRflXw9E8,What makes this game to change the football ?????
xbQRflXw9E8,No happen funking all white bad black
xbQRflXw9E8,"You know i had goosebumps watching the video and while sitting at my home watching this match i felt that coordination,emotion and bond that the players felt.I can feel that moment when the fans of you're club come to watch the match from different places,they come to support you there.I really think in that way that there are many clubs in football but barca is an emotion and i get goosebumps whenever watching the matches of barca no matter its mens or womens football but barca is everything.I remember watching the final of ucl (Barca vs Lyon)it was emotional to watch the moment when barca lost but winning is not everything,winning is a spirit and i felt like the barca players were having the spirit of winning the game.But then you can see how they won the uwcl final in 2023 against wolfsburg it was just incredible to see barca through the semifinals and final of the champions league and then to reach the final of uwcl and to win it obviously,it was a proud moment for barca fans and i really think that there should be equaliser in women's and mens football ‚öΩÔ∏è i think men's and women's  should be treated equal.Luckily now the womens football is getting that attention that they deserve but still there is no matter of gender,both men's and women's should be provided  the same opportunities to rech their full potential. Im in love with Messi and Alexia Putellas,the way they play is just amazing and can't be expressed in words,they both are simply the G.O.A.TüéâLegends........‚ù§"
xbQRflXw9E8,Women always follow men no matter what matter men do they never create anything new
xbQRflXw9E8,Women soccer is ridiculous. Not even 10 percent of mens perfomance.
xbQRflXw9E8,The best team and best club in the world. üíô‚ù§Ô∏è
xbQRflXw9E8,C.D. TACON
xbQRflXw9E8,"The catalyst that changed the women's game was the 2015 Women's World Cup. Not this game. That WC, lead to the growth and popularity of the women's game that was able to lead to this Barca record, england record etc. Sponsors and broadcasting are still a very big challenge to watch regular season games that aren't quarter/semi/finals matches."
xbQRflXw9E8,"And that's why Barca's ""Mes Que Un Club."""
xbQRflXw9E8,First 3 mins & i was criying.... it was just the introduction of the vid...
xbQRflXw9E8,"Barcelona is truly a football heritage club, very impactful in every aspect of football and how its played in today's world."
xbQRflXw9E8,Never forgive this club‚Äôs board for the way they treated the Most Decorated Player of their Club
xbQRflXw9E8,Bernabeu for women's game
xbQRflXw9E8,"Johan Cruyff, the one who asked the Barca board to invest into women's football in the early 90s , simply the best ü´∂üêê"
xbQRflXw9E8,Wow this was a very special game of football..üòä
xbQRflXw9E8,Thank you girls for making this wonderful world a better place to live and to dream more ‚Ä¶.
xbQRflXw9E8,"I just love how happy football makes people, regardless if its mens or womens football, this game is just so beautiful and I can never get over it. It's inspiring to see more support around womens football tho, this is just the beginning for us! Well done ladies!"
xbQRflXw9E8,Lol...oshoala didn't even play o
xbQRflXw9E8,"Barca femini plays football like they are dancing, like musical performance. Reminds me of pep's barca. Just beautiful to look at"
xbQRflXw9E8,"Its so emotional for those who love football,its amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è"

A guitar fretboard, and the scientific application of frequency manipulation for Time Travel:

~  zzzTIME TRAVEL...~ 
https://youtu.be/KFqNmE6SFy8

Guitar playing = Time Travel: scientifically, the proof is simplified on my napkin (and explained in the Video):

The guitar's fretboard enable's removal of all ""written"" representation of said ""music"" - including the ""measure"" portion of written music. 4/4; 5/4 etc.. or the beat. When the TIME SIGNATURE is removed, BOOM - time travel. Voila.

The guitar: On each string the following occurs along the fretboard [Whole tone = 2 spaces on the fretboard. Half tone = a single space on the fretboard]: Whole tone - Whole tone - Half tone - Whole tone - Whole tone - Whole tone - Half tone (repeat) = THE MAJOR SCALE. 

Guitar is all together the coolest thing."

xbQRflXw9E8,The barca squard is unbelievable. Their praying system is amazing. They deserve attention like that. One of the reasons i watched this game was because of la Reina Alexia Putellas. She is a superstar. They forced us to watch their matches ‚ù§
xbQRflXw9E8,What did this game change in womens football exactly?
xbQRflXw9E8,The best women‚Äôs soccer can do is YouTube deal and these girls are hilariously bad at this. 15 year olds boys destroy them. This is not fun to watch.
xbQRflXw9E8,"Truly loved it, thank you"
xbQRflXw9E8,"As so often, people decide and show what they want. As it turns out, that is football. I'm happy when I see the enthusiasm, the joy, the incredible game. The people there ‚Äì no one talking about which gender is playing. It's just soccer in all its beauty. ‚ù§"
xbQRflXw9E8,I was there
xbQRflXw9E8,I‚Äôm really happy for them
xbQRflXw9E8,It's possible only when there is match between Barca and real Madrid
xbQRflXw9E8,We need more of these documentaries ! Really great work DAZN
xbQRflXw9E8,more than club for a reason
xbQRflXw9E8,"I watched the game live ‚ù§
And as said in the video, I was searching Barca's pride in the women's team that time when the men aren't performing!
They are incredible
The game is incredible
Just like the fans, I watched till the stream ended that day, unlike all other days when I shut the browser/TV off as soon as game ends ‚ù§
Visca el Bar√ßa ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô

xbQRflXw9E8,Glad you made a video about that game. Otherwise I never would have known it was played. Millwall was playing that day. üëçüèª
xbQRflXw9E8,"*The USWNT (USA Women's Team) is what changed women's football forever and the game that changed women's football forever is the 1999 World Cup final between the US and China.  90,185 fans attended the final.  It was record-setting.  Without the US, women's football wouldn't exist at present.*"
xbQRflXw9E8,"Marvelous document, thank you Dazn. It really was special when you look at the atmosphere and the Joy of peolple. Also the semifinal against Wolfsburg or the Euro final at Wembley were terrific ganes. Lets hope for an exciting World Cup in Australia and many more to come. Im glad many people are riding this wave of womens football. It looks like a more healthy and fresh environment to me."
xbQRflXw9E8,"Camp nou tunnel is one of the iconic tunnel. Whenever i see in cinematic view from above the tunnel, it fills me with excitement."
xbQRflXw9E8,"""The game that changed WOMEN'S football""
have to put ""women"" in the title cause real football has been around for centuries and this game did nothing for that."
xbQRflXw9E8,"This is what we love about Barca. Alexia is Barca and Messi is BARC, BARC is Messi and camp nou is our birth place"
xbQRflXw9E8,I support woman's football.
xbQRflXw9E8,Barcelona is changing the woman‚Äôs football game. They promote it more than any other club.
xbQRflXw9E8,Truly more than a club ;)
xbQRflXw9E8,"Sure hope the ticket prices are the same as the men's, Hope the attendance isn't manipulated because of cheap tickets."
xbQRflXw9E8,This game gave big meaning and changed everything about women's football ‚ù§
xbQRflXw9E8,FCB is more than a club

xbQRflXw9E8,we have to really appreciate what DAZN is doing behind the scenes also apart from the on-screen activities to build and expand women's football to more and more people. can't really deny the efforts are impeccable. a step closer to equality in sports. thanks.

xbQRflXw9E8,"Barca is really a overwhelming team, its like prime barca but having messi injured and still untouchable. If they win the champions league this year like they have my full respect"
xbQRflXw9E8,Nothing new expected from a club such as Barcelona just as they revolutionized men‚Äôs football with Cruyff and Guardiola they are now doing it with the Women‚Äôs football too

Ma'am, there's atleast 3,000 people behind you."
xbQRflXw9E8,"once again Excellent coverage. I went off (mens) football about 20 years ago, got tired of the histrionics then at the last women's  world cup i started to watch & enjoy the women's skill & the honorable wat they behaved from then on i am a massive fan of women's foot ball but still cannot abide the men's game i ignored the world cup, basically the mens game is too girly lol"
xbQRflXw9E8,"Alexia is a type of player you can idolize her with no hesitation üòÖ her playing style fully different from other players‚ù§ 
I'm from Bangladesh and she is my idolüéâ not only me she is a idol of miliion dreamsüòå‚ù§"
xbQRflXw9E8,"take that, Franco"
xbQRflXw9E8,More than a club Barcelona the biggest football team in history not just by male football it‚Äôs more than that Barcelona basketball team is also the best
xbQRflXw9E8,"An awesome video! I am so proud to be that next generation that hopefully will play and experience these scenes, thank you to all the women who came before and those who are dominating now. This is not only about Barcelona, Real Madrid was very brave to step into this stadium and come out with a wonder goal. Insane scenes, and more to come!"
xbQRflXw9E8,"While people fight all over the world , female futbol is bringing a new light into women's sports . Equidad ‚ù§Ô∏è"
xbQRflXw9E8,"I wish the media would stop forcing this on us! If women's football is so popular then why doesn't it have its own peak time highlights show like  Match of the Day? Why doesn't it have its own Football Focus? Why do so called 'legends' of the women's game have to cover men's games and ruin them with their squealy, high pitched, 100mph commentary?  Why do we have to listen to women's opinions when trying to enjoy men's football?
Please, media, stop forcing the women's game on people who are NOT interested, it's intrusive!"
xbQRflXw9E8,"Feel so grateful to have seen Bar√ßa women play at Camp Nou. The most incredible atmosphere, never known anything like it!"
xbQRflXw9E8,Most tickets were for free.
xbQRflXw9E8,"Alexia is just one of those players, no matter what club you support, what country you're from, it doesn't matter. We all have the same amount of love and respect for her"
xbQRflXw9E8,of course Futbol Club Barcelona had to do it!!üî¥üîµüî¥üîµüí™üèºüí™üèºüí™üèºüí™üèºüí™üèºüí™üèº

xbQRflXw9E8,"This match really had it all: amazing atmosphere, classic rivalry, intense competition, spectacular goals, historic record, cultural impact‚Ä¶ all-in-all, a brilliant showing of the beautiful game that is football. Glad this story is being (re)told; it deserves to be memorialized. Thank you, DAZN, for livestreaming back then and for featuring it still now. Investment, accessibility, and representation are crucial for progress! üëèüôåü§ù"
xbQRflXw9E8,"Historic as it absolutely is, this match itself was in my view more the _culmination_ of a change that had already started, rather than being ""the change"" as such. And I'd also like point out how this very YT channel has absolutely been a vital part of said change, while I'm at it.¬†
Case in point, I myself have probably watched more whole matches of women's football in the past 2 years than all the years of my life before that combined!"
xbQRflXw9E8,"That day the women's Bar√ßa left an indelible mark on the history of world football. I am proud to support this club and proud of these players who gave everything on the pitch! 
That's why we are !M√©s que un club! üíô‚ù§Ô∏è"
xbQRflXw9E8,"Barcelona 21-22-23 is one of the best teams in the history of women's football but there is a huge asterisk next to its record.  Spanish Liga is a joke, is a one team league.  Barcelona wins all of its games (and I mean wins, not even one draw) is like a year long training session to be ready for Champions"
xbQRflXw9E8,‚ÄùMadrid are close to Bar√ßa. Bar√ßa have gotten a lot of 1-0 scraps in recent results.‚Äù Flashforward Madrid are still yet to DRAW a game against Barcelona. They have lost ALL games they have met Bar√ßa. Put some respect on our team. They aren‚Äôt even close.
xbQRflXw9E8,Even the real Madrid womans team loves penalties üòÇüòÇ as a barca fan I'm just hoping I get to see both mens and womens teams win a treble or quadruple in the same season üòäüòä

xbQRflXw9E8,"This is why Barca is the greatest club ever when it comes to impact. They changed the way modern football is played, they changed women football forever. rich history, trophies to back it up and passionate fans all around the world. Greatest club of my generation"
xbQRflXw9E8,This was such a brilliant game of football which had the best atmosphere I‚Äôve ever seen in any football game ever.

xbQRflXw9E8,This was indeed a spectacular moment. So great to watch. The Barcelona femeni team is the reason I enjoy watching women's football. I'm a Barca fan (men's and women's teams)

xbQRflXw9E8,We're more than a club we're family ‚ù§üíô‚ù§üíô visca el Bar√ßa
xbQRflXw9E8,"A nice story over a year of women's football at club level (this one) related to national level (Euro final). Thanks! It seems to focus on attendance as a measure of change/success.  Looking at women's World Cup stats, I note average game attendance in 1991 was 19,615 and in 2019 was 21,756; and peak attendance was in 1999 (90,185). So, I prefer broader measures to decide a 'game that changed football' such as: girls participation, add tv /online attendances, number of clubs and nations playing over time etc. I expect most will show continued growth. And I look forward to, and hope, in July that many national fans will travel here (ANZ) to boost average attendances. Doing so may show this match did indeed help change women's football!"
xbQRflXw9E8,"Hmm, not sure I agree with the title. The sheer number of fans must have been in response to something else, so this game was the RESULT of something that changed football."
xbQRflXw9E8,I pray Alexia is healthy for the World Cup!
xbQRflXw9E8,Will be in the away section on Thursday 27 April to see if my Chelsea Women can pull off another historic upset like the Men's team did at Camp Nou in 2012. It is amazing to think that I will have the opportunity to watch the last-ever Champions League football match at the old Camp Nou and it will be Women on the pitch for this occasion. Thank you for putting together this important video.

I really hope they win the Champions league this year"
xbQRflXw9E8,I was there. Great atmosphere
xbQRflXw9E8,"What moved me the most when I watched the games at Camp Nou and Wembley was the effect it had on the faces of the young girls in the crowd. Here were heroes of the woman‚Äôs game being acclaimed in front of them by colossal numbers. How many of those young girls will go on to be heroes of the game themselves? How many will go on to move the world in so many other ways because they were shown, in no uncertain terms, that women can and will do anything?"

sh-ZTLFblko,Both arsenal men and women teams defense is so bad
sh-ZTLFblko,I love arsenal but I have a feeling that Barca will win
sh-ZTLFblko,I don't see a lot of competition for Barca from either side
sh-ZTLFblko,"Katie McCabe at it again. Getting an unnecessary yellow card because she can‚Äôt keep herself in check. It only benefits her opponents, so carry on!"
sh-ZTLFblko,arsenal is massive
sh-ZTLFblko,referee was so bad
IuPzyJRV1cg,32:40 Oops easy goal
IuPzyJRV1cg,"Oberdorff and McCabe, two fighters... and both, great players."
IuPzyJRV1cg,brilliant coverage
IuPzyJRV1cg,"Dissapointing performance by Wolfsburgo mainly beacuse Arsenal have half of starter injured and can we talk about Mccabe i think she deserved a red card,, but if Wolfsburgo not win at least 2-0 this match they should be worried the winner of semifinal 1 still favorite"
IuPzyJRV1cg,Jonsdottir block pajor celebration
IuPzyJRV1cg,"61.00 zinsberger down...this has got to stop...the GK suddenly, and for no reason, collapses to the ground so all the team then go for 'extra' coaching session...its funny that as soon as the coaching stops, she miraculously get better !! this is becoming endemic in WSL...all REFs STOP THIS NOW...."
IuPzyJRV1cg,"Love the spirit, never back down girls. #loveyou#little#foord#arsenalladies"
IuPzyJRV1cg,"1:56:15 is a straight red card for McCabe, I don't understand the decision to only give a yellow card."
IuPzyJRV1cg,"Lucky day for the gunners, because the 2:2 was an offside goal üòÆ!
   Also, McCabe should have gotten a red card for the intentional assault üòñ against Oberdorf. Ansolute unsportsmanlike and unnecessary hazardüëé.
Very weak referee üòµ‚Äçüí´ üëé."
IuPzyJRV1cg,What celebration did 1st goal do
IuPzyJRV1cg,neither of them beats Barcelona
IuPzyJRV1cg,Great game. Wonderful comeback by the Gunners. I hope they can finish the job in the return leg.
IuPzyJRV1cg,Wolfsburg - the lucky draw team. We can be expected from the team with poor ball control & poor ball passing - the 2 basic skills in football
IuPzyJRV1cg,I love this channel soooooo much.
IuPzyJRV1cg,Wolfsburg wins in London. No doubt about it. Like they did away against Paris SG and Bayern M√ºnchen
IuPzyJRV1cg,"Up gunner, what a come back, excellent job"
IuPzyJRV1cg,referee was so bad
IuPzyJRV1cg,Only arsenal can do comebacks this season
IuPzyJRV1cg,Woman football trash
IuPzyJRV1cg,I see Jonas build this team by amount of player put the Arsenal play with great system even miss a crucial player still can play on very high level game.
IuPzyJRV1cg,Knew the gunners would do their thing.. should have won but great work!...üí™second leg will be ours no doubt
IuPzyJRV1cg,"Great result for Arsenal after being 2-0 down , fancy them for the final now"
IuPzyJRV1cg,great playing from both teams !!!
IuPzyJRV1cg,from 2-0 to 2-2

hITemNjXkDg,üéâüéâ without ALEXIA üò¢
StRJuKYKZFo,"44:01 She isn't saying it hit her in the face. That gesture is for a Spanish expression ""Having a hard face"". It's said when someone has done something that she/he should be ashamed of."
StRJuKYKZFo,"Go to bed shut up
Or ill get you"
StRJuKYKZFo,Whenever you play Chelsea you also have to play against the Ref!
StRJuKYKZFo,"This is a great game with great teams. Imagine, the talent  with Sam, Hansen, Mapi, Atiana, Rolfo, My favorites are Barca but, WoW, what a game the camera does not do it justice.With the equipment, they could do a lot better on the individual effort."
StRJuKYKZFo,"Wow, I just saw Mapi in the backfield, this game is in the bag!
iguana"
StRJuKYKZFo,Nice matches ‚ù§üåπüëçüíûüíì
StRJuKYKZFo,this must have been painful for the commentator. she desperately wanted chelsea to win. Bwaahahahahahah!!!  ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
StRJuKYKZFo,"Chelsea do conquer so far , all Teams except Barcelona who prove more resistance !!"
StRJuKYKZFo,"This is my first time watching an entire female match an now I wanna see how this ends. Next leg here we goo, and yes ik the match happened a few months ago but am jus seeing it üòä"
StRJuKYKZFo,As early as possibility.
StRJuKYKZFo,why is there man city girl in the thumbnail bro thought we didn't notice 
StRJuKYKZFo,FC Bar√ßalona is the best club in the world ‚ù§üíô
StRJuKYKZFo,"Hope DAZN/UWCL will get a new commentators. These two ladies just talk too much shii.
That solo guy commentating from previous match PSG vs Wolfsburg is perfect."
StRJuKYKZFo,All coaches respect All girls I Loved All coaches of habit and All time my best game girl football real
StRJuKYKZFo,ngl i‚Äôm happy that 700k people watch women football
StRJuKYKZFo,"This Barcelona W side is just pure football, Jonatan Giraldez is one manager to watch, the Pep Guardiola of W football"
StRJuKYKZFo,Sam Kerr‚Äôs ball IQ is pretty insane. So is Bronze‚Äôs. Look how she laid an offside trap for Kerr
StRJuKYKZFo,The reporting was so crummy that I turned off the sound. Who needs them anyway. The woman was coarse and blindly biased. Is this the best DAZN can afford? There actually are qualified professional football commentators out there but they don't work for pennies.
StRJuKYKZFo,"Too bad that shortly after half-time Chelsea hat 7 fouls and Barcelona had only one questionable foul. Game statistic like shots on frame made Chelsea look bad. It wasn't only the goal that put Barcelona ahead, it was their better playing overall. They were just better. But these games really mean so very little because they are a fiesta of foreigners and not a Spanish city vs. a UK city. Two or more Brits played for Spain for example. Local patriotism and a little pride in your country folk can never arise under these circumstances. Something is systemically wrong when you cannot even be proud of YOUR team."
StRJuKYKZFo,Chelsea midfield balance has been a problem for awhile...
StRJuKYKZFo,Barca should move and play in WSL not in Liga F.
StRJuKYKZFo,The goalkeeper of Chelsea dd a great job
StRJuKYKZFo,"Glad to see Pernille Harder is back and hope, Lucy Bronze is not seriously injured!"
StRJuKYKZFo,"Brilliant goal, however I can understand why they get paid so much less... There's just no element of competition it's like they're having a coffee and occasionally someone interrupts them. There's like no real desire to be the best."
StRJuKYKZFo,"Chelsea defense saved them. Honestly,  I love how Bracelona plays"
StRJuKYKZFo,5:55 Mapi got bulldozed üò≥ ...but smooth how she popped right back up.
StRJuKYKZFo,To many ads on this match hard to watch
StRJuKYKZFo,This video is awful. The audio commentary is lagging about 7 minutes behind the gameplay.
StRJuKYKZFo,"Luck day for Chelsea, or? Barcelona has two 100% chances left."
StRJuKYKZFo,well done  Barcelona
StRJuKYKZFo,Putellas will be back‚ù§
StRJuKYKZFo,I was at the stadium whatching the game

StRJuKYKZFo,VAMOS POR OTRA CHAMPIONS!!! SOMOS EL MEJOR CLUB QUE HA PARIDO LA TIERRA ü§´ü§©üòçüíô‚ù§Ô∏èüíô‚ù§Ô∏è
StRJuKYKZFo,"Love your videos and this free coverage of the games. Just one small issue: Can hear what might be Spanish commentators in the background - your microphones seem to be picking them up too. Might be something worth experimenting with your sound setup, and trying to eliminate for other games."
StRJuKYKZFo,"Barcelona were all over them, the only reason it wasn't 4-0 was the brilliant Chelsea defence. üëç"
StRJuKYKZFo,Idk what happens to barca when they play Lyon
StRJuKYKZFo,Please can you add the commentary language to the title for live streams.  I always select the wrong one!
StRJuKYKZFo,I don‚Äòt even know which team i want to Support‚Ä¶
StRJuKYKZFo,Chelsea ‚ù§
StRJuKYKZFo,Resume about this match... 06:33 (67 sec.). Indra¬¥s arrow by Graham.
StRJuKYKZFo,Need improvement in passing. Sam Kerr was poor today.
StRJuKYKZFo,Horrible time to play üò°
StRJuKYKZFo,14:24 üò≤ CGH‚Äôs goal is almost a carbon copy of the one she scored last week against Atl√©tico Madrid. Guess she found her sweet spot now!
StRJuKYKZFo,1:58:43 Oshoala dribble it out the field. 1:55:54 she can't even control the ball. No wonder she was on the bench...
StRJuKYKZFo,DAZN needs to sack the commentators. Disgraceful and totally biased. I bet the two morons wore the Chelsea shirt at the booth. Glad that Real Madrid mopped the floor with the men's game.
StRJuKYKZFo,Bye bye Chelsea!
StRJuKYKZFo,What biased commentary? It's two Chelsea die hard fans talking about Chelsea only. Fire those commentators. Chelsea are one nil down but those dazn clowns are talking as if Chelsea are 5-0 or something. Absolutely pathetic to see such bias in the UEFA Women's Champions League
StRJuKYKZFo,what a strike :OOO
StRJuKYKZFo,"""Advantage goes to Chelsea"" üòÇ"

peXtyX5FIDY,She's always shy
peXtyX5FIDY,"Geyse is going to be massive after the World Cup. She is such a talent and has improved so much since signing for Barca. It just goes to show that if you give players the proper facilities and resources, they will excel. Clubs across the league need to invest more in their women's teams to see these improvements. In turn everybody benefits as the product is of a higher quality and attracts more viewers."
peXtyX5FIDY,"Please DAZN more Geyse!! A lot of stars will be born in this world cup and judging from the two friendlies with both England and Germany, Geyse is at the top of that list. Can't wait for the world to see her talent üòä"

xvzvx3h-ErE,"I got them all right except the Eurovision Q.  BUT the big takeaway is how to pronounce ""Van Gogh"".  And yes.  I'm looking at you, America..."
0XcgPClgN9k,"Its all nice and everything, if you compare it to the conditions of other women club teams for example in the bundesliga in Germany. But if you compare it to the Fc Bayern men section that's just a huge joke! I hope more people start to see the potential of women in sport more , especially in those big rich clubs like fcb, and support them more like they deserve:) 
Thanks Jovana for showing it, it was fun!"
0XcgPClgN9k,"jovana has the passion and the fire , visible whenever she is on the pitch"
0XcgPClgN9k,Hopefully facilities will continue to improve as the game grows. Nice to get to know Jovana a bit off the pitch.

a5D254_HR6c,The Assist For Me
a5D254_HR6c,"Why didn't they show Lyon's ‚Äúpenalty‚Äù on James? It's a 128th minute tie decider, hugely contested by neutral spectators, yet you hide it? Tut, tut, tut.... ü§®"
a5D254_HR6c,Mate give the music a F--cking rest
a5D254_HR6c,So how does this video have anything to do with your headline write up. Or you just want to earn followers and likes using Arsenal name. You are a disgrace

my3PuEMMNP4,I honestly enjoyed this ‚ù§
my3PuEMMNP4,What a team arsenal ‚ù§
735LtBt6I5o,"top 10 saves of the secon leg and the first one starts with the commentor saying ""straight in the arms...""  i just can't with you... make a top 5, would look less sad becaus the top 5 saves were actually worth talking about..."
735LtBt6I5o,Ceasar's safe was the best - by far!
735LtBt6I5o,4:04 Ann-Katrin Berger saves for a Semifinal.
735LtBt6I5o,"without Grohs, Bayern would have lost 5:0 to Arsenal"
4_bgyr5TbAg,"i use to hate womens football, now i absolutely love it xD"
4_bgyr5TbAg,meet barcelona will surely loseüòÅ
4_bgyr5TbAg,All the best to Melanie!
4_bgyr5TbAg,Shocking how Bayern had absolutely no chances.
4_bgyr5TbAg,Why has Roma Keep such a short goal keeper
4_bgyr5TbAg,It's clear must be not penalty for Chelsea. Lucky
4_bgyr5TbAg,#French bashing
4_bgyr5TbAg,"Watch the replay, Lyon player clipped Lauren‚Äôs foot. Fact is, it was an undisputed penalty. Face the truth people. I do add that the ref wasn‚Äôt the sharpest tool in the shed, turning a blind eye when the angry little Dutch girl damaged  Leupolz‚Äôs nose. That should have been a red card."
4_bgyr5TbAg,"DAZN wow 1080p that is actually 1080p !!! the full games was supposedly 1080p60, and was the usual fuzzy nearer 480p...why cant whole games be this clear and sharp ???????????"
XVRlNJxakqA,Came back to this and I want to say Lauren James is a brilliant player
XVRlNJxakqA,March 28 im here in emma hayes we trust
XVRlNJxakqA,"The person with the highest score in this match is Danielle Van de Donk.
A completely different game from the first half, Lyon needs to understand the value of the bright Dutch star. Chelsea players didn't even have the desired passes with DvD's smart play and high pressing!"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Its not penalty.
Anyway, congrats chelsea"
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren gameplay like Reece üíô
XVRlNJxakqA,The Best team lose
XVRlNJxakqA,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ they are so funny
XVRlNJxakqA,Nice extended highlights ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
XVRlNJxakqA,Anybody help me with the name of the comentator please
XVRlNJxakqA,Vamos Chelsea üî•üî•üî•
XVRlNJxakqA,"But honestly, was this really the best thumbnail pic you could think of for this clip?! I mean, just look at that hand placement..."
XVRlNJxakqA,"The Chelsea goalkeeper illegally overtakes in the 2 penalties she saved. I don't know if in the female the rule in penalties is the same as in the male. The referee was very weak, she didn't see the overtaking, she didn't see the penalty at minute 120, they had to warn her about the var and the backhand that they gave Melanie Leupolz who had to leave due to the endless bleeding she had from her nose didn't see it either."
XVRlNJxakqA,Am a Chelsea fan but that first assist and goal from Lyon ladies was sweet.
XVRlNJxakqA,Bravo....am happy for my club
XVRlNJxakqA,"The one that took the penalty, then stepped up first in the shootout has massive balls under pressure"
XVRlNJxakqA,"No penalty, no way thats a penalty, ex ref."
XVRlNJxakqA,Out make team will also knockout the make champions league holders Real Madrid
XVRlNJxakqA,Jessie Fleming stepping up for a PK for Chelsea ..... reminded me instantly of the Japan Summer Olympics. (Does she ever miss a PK?)
XVRlNJxakqA,"Nice saves, those goalkeepers are top notch in the women's league"
XVRlNJxakqA,Maybe the men can take a bit from this.
XVRlNJxakqA,All the people that watched the match but stopped at 120 mins should be watching the replay after every match. Imagine that it was after you left watching that they won.
XVRlNJxakqA,It was dramatic match.
XVRlNJxakqA,I love Chelsea from Thailand
XVRlNJxakqA,For me it's the Drogba run buy the goal keeperüòÖü•áüèÜüíØüí™üáØüá≤üôåüèøüôÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,"All the males you see here,we're forced to come by their girlfriends"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Real Madrid be like: nah Lyon Feminin is too weak, let us teach Chelsea a lesson."
XVRlNJxakqA,That's not a penalty for Chelsea woman.
XVRlNJxakqA,"As usual . Anyone plays against a British team and referees begin whistling as referees to Barcelona in la Liga. Only time is was right was the final of 66 . But after everything divided is always on the bit team (as if Europe is  a colony of UK and they have to have always the benefit. I'm not a fan o Lyon or Chelsea . ""se got clicked"" and you are blind .  There are a lot of games where brit players hit even harder and you guys ignore it or play nothing happend."
XVRlNJxakqA,"Eriksson is a liability in that defence.

I can't wait for Millie Bright to be back, so she's dropped to the bench."
XVRlNJxakqA,why were lyon so mad about the pk>? what were they complaining about>?
XVRlNJxakqA,"Lots of comments about the last-gasp penalty for Chelsea. Of course there is contact but James leans into her opponent to create it. The defender does not make a tackle at all, she just ""jockeys"". Not a penalty in my view. Chelsea so, so lucky."
XVRlNJxakqA,missed the clip of leupolz getting her head bashed in this game was literally war out there it had everything
XVRlNJxakqA,YNWA ..well done Chelsea..
XVRlNJxakqA,I am a Chelsea fan and that wasn't a penalty. She kicked herself.
XVRlNJxakqA,Very generous penalty! Lyon played better and deserved to win
XVRlNJxakqA,"Women Football Grown like wow

What a game KTBFFH üíôüíôüíô"
XVRlNJxakqA,I thought Lyon would have gone through with away goals
XVRlNJxakqA,When did Chelsea score their second goal?
XVRlNJxakqA,Did anyone come here jus to see Melanie Leupolz injury‚Ä¶I mean I really don‚Äôt see why another reason why to‚Ä¶ women‚Äôs football hella boring ü•±
XVRlNJxakqA,"Jessie Fleming also scored a Penalty, not shown... ü§î"
XVRlNJxakqA,Joke of a penalty lol
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea penalty isn't deserve I think for me as Chelsea fans but this kind of case type is usually happen at least we've going to semi finals üòÅ
XVRlNJxakqA,What a game!!!!
XVRlNJxakqA,Clear and obvious error?
XVRlNJxakqA,How is that a pen üòÇ. Getting level with the mens game I guess with shocking VAR calls
XVRlNJxakqA,"That Chelsea lady knows how to take a penalty. Unlike Neymar and other ""experts""."
XVRlNJxakqA,How is this a penalty?
XVRlNJxakqA,Kepa definitely trained Berger on penalties
XVRlNJxakqA,"Soft one, but she was clipped"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea üîµ
XVRlNJxakqA,Superb by Chelsea
XVRlNJxakqA,Best womens match I‚Äôve seen so far by far
XVRlNJxakqA,So women goalkeepers are allowed to come off their line in penalties but men aren‚Äôt? Is that a rule now is it?
XVRlNJxakqA,Seriously poor quality
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James and his brother Reece are amazing players
XVRlNJxakqA,Congratulations our Chelsea ladies
XVRlNJxakqA,Hope the boys can do it
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James cheated at the end to get that penalty !!!!  OL LYON did the job !
XVRlNJxakqA,That was nice to watch #CFC
XVRlNJxakqA,Great game! Turn down the Vol on the commentator!!
XVRlNJxakqA,Recce James must teach her sister how to take spots
XVRlNJxakqA,"When you can't win, you cheat, nicely done James, what a player, what a diver ! ü§£"
XVRlNJxakqA,Incredible game but Chelsea is lucky. Well done but Barcelona will crush them next round. 0 chance to get the final. Chelsea is an old version of kick & rush.
XVRlNJxakqA,It's an outrage‚Ää !
XVRlNJxakqA,Was never a penalty. Referees seem to give English teams penalties all the time now. Its become very predictable
XVRlNJxakqA,Surely each save was off the line? Chelsea fan here btw but the last pen was 6yr box üòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,"Vamos Barca , thank you Chelsea for KO the French champ , who‚Äôs always a hurdle for Barca in UCL .My vote goes to Barca to win UCL.Chelsea deserves it today .Superb Game ."
XVRlNJxakqA,That‚Äôs not a pen!!!
XVRlNJxakqA,That's not penalty!.. Lyon was robbed!
XVRlNJxakqA,I love Lauren James but that was not really a Penalty. She just threw herself down ro get a Penalty. The first Penalty for Lyon was supposed to be retaken because The Chelsea Goalkeeper came out of her line before the Penalty was Kicked. Why not use the same rules in Women's Soccer football as they are used in Men's?
XVRlNJxakqA,"Well done, but the case for Equal pay, I don't think so if this is the top quality football on show, then there is a very long way to go in Quality. But very well done in getting to the semi-finals Ladies."
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James really need to work on her shooting accuracy
XVRlNJxakqA,Great fight and determination! Well done Chelsea Ladies !
XVRlNJxakqA,"Despite the qualified Chelsea hardly spring passes together last night 
And I was so annoyed...
Congratulations to them though"
XVRlNJxakqA,My Queens!
XVRlNJxakqA,That was not the penalty!! Corrupted UEFA!!!
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea no7 is absolutely useless
XVRlNJxakqA,Goalies off their line every kick ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
XVRlNJxakqA,"xG of James estimated: 5% 
xG of Penalty estimated: 70% 
Yes. There might be some touch on her leg. But do we really want that worth of an almost sure goal?
VAR has solve some problems. But it has created other ones in exchange."
XVRlNJxakqA,Heart break
XVRlNJxakqA,"Congratulations Ladies best Chelsea game to watch all year,Emma how about coaching the men's team as well üòä"
XVRlNJxakqA,Soft PK to call.. but congratulations on beating the champs
XVRlNJxakqA,I wish they showed the last penalty from down the end line. It looked suspiciously like the keeper‚Äôs feet were off the line but from our angle you can‚Äôt tell.
XVRlNJxakqA,"chelsea  keeper one the 2 penalties was fault  , she move forward of the line amazing the referee didn't call"
XVRlNJxakqA,Come on Chelsea!!
XVRlNJxakqA,"The penalty came from a fall in terrupting his own leg.
 Referees look at var why
 I now watch more women's football than mens football James dived clearly although cheering for James in the England nation team"
XVRlNJxakqA,Why was there no players on the edge of the box when the penalty was taken at the end of extra time ?
XVRlNJxakqA,My only wish is we have full squad fit against Barca.
XVRlNJxakqA,If that was a penalty then every game would be filled with penalties
XVRlNJxakqA,what a frigging game
XVRlNJxakqA,i thought keepers were supposed to stay on their line
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea Capt needs to defend well against Barca or else they'll be thrashed
XVRlNJxakqA,Are we gonna see a all London Final?
XVRlNJxakqA,How was that a penalty Lyon was robbed
XVRlNJxakqA,"That was a very soft penalty and a really poor and costly decision by the referee. Believe it or not, contact IS allowed in football. üôÑ"
XVRlNJxakqA,"so you clip your own leg, fall over and the ref gives a penalty-worse then the mens game-cheating and diving"
XVRlNJxakqA,Up up the Blues üí™üèæüíôüíôüíô
XVRlNJxakqA,Not being funny but my 14 year old nephew could of saved that second lyon goal üôà
XVRlNJxakqA,Up the Chels!!
XVRlNJxakqA,That was never a penalty James tripped herself up
XVRlNJxakqA,Leo deserved win
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea Chelsea Chelsea üíôüíôüíô
XVRlNJxakqA,"Erikson and Kaloubaly have similar playing styles in terms of errors, miss kicks and wrong decision wise üòÇ Todd should buy Maria Leon from Barca üòä with those kind of errors, we're lucky to win . Sam Kerr should stop wasting 1v1 chances ; composer is required to burry those chances"
XVRlNJxakqA,I stopped watching after Lyons second goal. went back and it was penalty shootout and I couldn't believe it. What happened in 15minü§îI'm proud of my ladiesüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíô
XVRlNJxakqA,Emma Hayes should replace potter
XVRlNJxakqA,That wasn't even a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,Stamford Bridge is one special place üò¢
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea goal keeper is the man of the match üòç
XVRlNJxakqA,What a game. I dont usually watch womens footy but i will now. Wow.
XVRlNJxakqA,I thought penalty controversy only happened in male football. üòÅ Coz that was nowhere a penalty.
XVRlNJxakqA,The James siblings‚òÄ‚òÄüåü
XVRlNJxakqA,That Lyon defender is dumb. No need to touch james
XVRlNJxakqA,Why 120 min??
XVRlNJxakqA,Intensive game. What a game from the ladies.
XVRlNJxakqA,Never a pen
XVRlNJxakqA,"Ashamed. Imaginary penalty, Lyon was robbed by arbitration. What is VAR for?"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Chelsea has to play at Aston Villa Sunday.
They'll be worn out and sore.

Aston Villa isn't going to win a top 3 spot this season but they're going to wreck some dreams."
XVRlNJxakqA,That last minute penalty was definitely not a pen üòÇüòÇüòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,"Never a penalty, she felt some contact then put her foot back to be clipped. Clever, but depressing."
XVRlNJxakqA,That is bad refereeing
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James is world Class. Lauren James is world Class. Lauren James is world Class. Lauren James is world Class.
XVRlNJxakqA,what a game
XVRlNJxakqA,wait can someone explain why the players werent surrounding the box for mjelde's penalty in extra time
XVRlNJxakqA,"Well done ladies, you make you‚Äôre own luck but class is class."
XVRlNJxakqA,"To be fair, that was no way a penalty!! 
According to this ref, any sort of touch is foul"
XVRlNJxakqA,"The Lionesses legacy continues with two English teams into the last four of the Champions League. Congratulations Chelsea. It was a 12 round chess match where both team frustrated each other. Fantastic to see Potter, James and a few others from the men‚Äôs team supporting their teammates. Hope Leupolz is ok."
XVRlNJxakqA,It‚Äôs an inescapable fact that the Chelsea player dived for the penalty. Even the most biased supporter sees that.
XVRlNJxakqA,Scandalous‚Ä¶how far off her line is the Chelsea keeper on these penalties‚Ä¶as for Lauren James what a diving cheat‚Ä¶shame on you.
XVRlNJxakqA,Congratulations
XVRlNJxakqA,"Well done Chelsea Women amazing stuff but terribly edited highlights. Chopping off commentary all over the place , poor cross fades and Lyon Women‚Äôs second penalty is missing. So confusing to watch. Come on Dazn, you‚Äôre better than this"
XVRlNJxakqA,"NEVER A PENALTY-NEVER. I don't think there was even any contact but if there was, the Chelsea striker has been waiting for a TINY touch & cheated via diving-pathetic. STOP WATCHING THE MEN'S GAME GIRLS!!! The commentators all forget it is a contact sport & contact is allowed in the rules of the game."
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon missed a lot of chances
XVRlNJxakqA,This penalty a shame
XVRlNJxakqA,"Commentator, you can be excited you know you've just witnessed a 128th minute equaliser in a champions league quarter final and she sounds like she's just watched her cat die"
XVRlNJxakqA,Y the penalty when it‚Äôs 2:1
XVRlNJxakqA,"It wasn't a lucky day for Erickssen, our skipper"
XVRlNJxakqA,The chelsea Keeper for women is better than Kepa in Penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,That wasn‚Äôt a penalty but congrats to chelsea üëèüèø
XVRlNJxakqA,the women football is like when you start master league and all your players run slower and shoot like they pass...
XVRlNJxakqA,How is no one talking about Lauren James? Such a great player! what a player?
XVRlNJxakqA,How was that a pen üòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,Crazy UCL night at the bridge what do you expect üéâ
XVRlNJxakqA,James was unplayable üí•üí•
XVRlNJxakqA,"How was that penalty given üòÇüòÇ, sooooo soft."
XVRlNJxakqA,"We kinda played bad ngl
I expect more from eriksson"
XVRlNJxakqA,There's no penalty at the end of the game. What a robbery...
XVRlNJxakqA,Question is: who cares?
XVRlNJxakqA,"ok, fair play to chelsea for getting through but i thought they left too many gaps in midfield & could have been destroyed only for Lyon were off their game, they will be annihilated by Barcelona if they do that in semis, plus the Lyon first penno miss should have been retaken as the keeper came way off her line, but look its done now so they have to focus on the nxt game"
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm glad Chelsea got through but with both Chelsea saves it did look like the keeper was off her line. I didn't see the penalties live, just this footage."
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm a Chelsea fan and I love the women team so much as they have been the joy of Chelsea fans this season. That being said, that was not a penalty. And if they don't play better, Barcelona women will blow them away...........the penalty take Mjelde was cool as ice"
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon deserved to win but it was a foolish challenge by Becho and it cost them dearly...  And even Lyon would've struggled against Barcelona in the semi's.  Chelsea have even less of a chance but an upset is always possible.
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren and Reece are TRUE jems of this club... even mason mount... proper chels
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'll admit that I stopped watching at the 119th minute, what little faith I have! Well-done you superb Chelsea ladies!"
XVRlNJxakqA,I'm happy for our keeper's input during the shootouts but not during the open-play.
XVRlNJxakqA,"Never a pen tbh, nevertheless Bar√ßa is waiting üòà"
XVRlNJxakqA,The best club üôáüíÅü¶Åüíô
XVRlNJxakqA,Never a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James is special. What a player üíØüíØüî•üî•
XVRlNJxakqA,That was no penalty...
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm sorry but Erikson makes me nervous. She doesn't convince me one bit. I can't believe she's the captain. She makes so many mistakes. That first goal of Lyon, she was ball watching and doesn't mark the 1st post. Second Lyon goal was also her fault. She failed to position herself well to be able to clear the ball. I wish Bright will be back for the semis. Erikson is too raw for me, I'm sorry. Chelsea should consider getting another Buchanan to back Bright."
XVRlNJxakqA,I fall in  love we this Chelsea women's
XVRlNJxakqA,But how was that a pen ??
XVRlNJxakqA,great game on both team
XVRlNJxakqA,"Ericsson tried to bottle it up for Chelsea,Bright was missed,Lauren James is our best player this season,Mjelda and Carter all had a wonderful night,Berger is the hero of the night"
XVRlNJxakqA,shame on Chelsea with an imagineray penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,"Chelsea keeper came off her line before Lyon players struck the ball for both penalties saved at the end, should have been retaken."
XVRlNJxakqA,"What the Men can do, the Women can do better"
XVRlNJxakqA,How the tables turn at the last minute. Holding the ball inside the penalty area and hoping someone fouls you can change a whole game
XVRlNJxakqA,I was crying üò≠‚Ä¶. But happy
XVRlNJxakqA,Ericsson almost did 2 big mistakes on both legs üòÖüòÖüòÖ
XVRlNJxakqA,"Berger, Frohms, Grohs, and in the last years Schult, Angerer, Rottenberg... Germany has the greatest GK on earth without any doubt!"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea is massive! üîµ
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea with ANOTHER robberyüíÄ
XVRlNJxakqA,James has a future in acting... Chelsea has the most players who take the best penalty kicks!
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea fan but that was no penalty. She should be auditioning in Hollywood.
XVRlNJxakqA,First penalty wasn¬¥t correct  !!!
XVRlNJxakqA,That soft penalty robbery really üòÇüòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,Can't wait for the World Cup...watching how great all these players are so far....its awesome!
XVRlNJxakqA,"But Chelsea need to work on defence , everything is okay"
XVRlNJxakqA,She's gonna win ballodor if she plays like this and by the help of her teammates
XVRlNJxakqA,Same old Chelsea always cheating
XVRlNJxakqA,wasn't a penalty though
XVRlNJxakqA,That's not a penalty. And the Chelsea keeper goes out of the line. It's should have been a retake
XVRlNJxakqA,And Where is The penalty?
XVRlNJxakqA,Wow...... infact I gave up on the ladies and stopped watching when the second goal went in. I woke up only this morning seeing a pop up on my phone about the result. Great win from my Blue Ladies.... well done. üíôüëåüíô
XVRlNJxakqA,"Love this channel..
Your highlights are always clear"
XVRlNJxakqA,Do they not check the keeper coming off the line for penalties in the woman‚Äôs game?
XVRlNJxakqA,The last penalty rule violation by Berger..So Chelsea didn't deserve.
XVRlNJxakqA,Nobody talking about the terrible penalty decision that ruined the whole tie?
XVRlNJxakqA,We‚Äôve all Withness something last nightüòÇüòÇüòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,"Thanks for showing these great games freely, DAZN."
XVRlNJxakqA,Wmns champion league is getting better and better
XVRlNJxakqA,"a game where defences & midfield ruled, cuthbert & Van da donk, Buccanan & Renard were all brilliant"
XVRlNJxakqA,"I was literally so sad in in last 2 mins had no hope but then Lauren got clipped. VAR you know what that means, pen. I WAS SCARED for my life. The way we scored that pen was cool. World class. And the fact that we won on penalties, I can call this best game of tournament so far. I was delighted"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Lauren will get better and better, shes a beast wallahi ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ"
XVRlNJxakqA,That is no where near a penalty haha shocking decision absolutely
XVRlNJxakqA,"Also the last Lyon s penalty, Chelsea goalkeeper left her line early ........."
XVRlNJxakqA,At this point we need to transfer some of these women to the men's team... üíôüíôüíôLOVE THE SPIRIT..COYB
XVRlNJxakqA,That penalty in xtra time isnt a penalty tho
XVRlNJxakqA,I am happy there are fans supporting them in this game. Congratulations to both sides for having amazing fans. Entertaining game had us on the edge of our seat. The late drama is just typical champions league spirit üòä. Nice to see this kind of scene in women's game.
XVRlNJxakqA,The celebrating for lyons first goalüòÇüòÇüòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,"The last minute , are you sure penalty for Chelsea ? 
I think is not penalty üòÇ"
XVRlNJxakqA,samm kerr missing chances
XVRlNJxakqA,Never a penalty though
XVRlNJxakqA,No penalty lol
XVRlNJxakqA,"Lauren James is world class, world class!"
XVRlNJxakqA,Ucl at stamford bridge just hits different üíô
XVRlNJxakqA,What a rediculous penalty decision in minute 120. The referees seem to like Chelsea in international gamesüí∏
XVRlNJxakqA,Never a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea will be destroyed by Barcelona 22 April üòé
XVRlNJxakqA,Cuthbert is the N'golo Kante of the ladies team. She was a monster in that midfield
XVRlNJxakqA,"Chelsea got a nice present with that 90+2 ""penalty""..."
XVRlNJxakqA,The Chelsea  captain is the weak link in the defence I have watched many matches were she gives away silly balls that lead to goal......
XVRlNJxakqA,"That penalty by Mjelde was on another level compared to the last few penalties taken by havertz. She was so calm and composed. Havertz on the other side, misses his first penalty after beoming the main penalty taker since jorghinos departure. Luckily he got to retake it."
XVRlNJxakqA,Don't goallies have to stay on their line until pens are taken in the women's game?
XVRlNJxakqA,Who is that Chelsea's number 16?   Worst player on the pitch. What a disaster.
XVRlNJxakqA,Best match in the competition so far. Intensity and quality all round.
XVRlNJxakqA,"I that Barcelona were the once who is paying ref, but I was wrong, how is that a penalty?ü§£üòÇ"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea captain is useless
XVRlNJxakqA,I turned it off at 2 minutes into injury time extra time and only just found out that they did give that penalty.
XVRlNJxakqA,WHAT A GAME! PROUD OF THE BLUES
XVRlNJxakqA,Fkin VAR saved us tbh
XVRlNJxakqA,"no penalty for me, James were searching the contact, see how the left leg bends to the right to the defender...."
XVRlNJxakqA,This James's family was born for footfall‚ù§
XVRlNJxakqA,Sam kerr is a magic for chelsea
XVRlNJxakqA,i dont like that 120min var decision to give a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,"So much drama at the end of this match! And heartbreaking to see Horan crying after the penalty save. 
May the best teams get through to the final!"
XVRlNJxakqA,Erikson making such huge mistakes twice  and costing the team üò¢
XVRlNJxakqA,"üòÇüòÇüòÇ whats, pinalty???"
XVRlNJxakqA,"If we can overcome Barca, we will win it."
XVRlNJxakqA,So proud of Chelsea tonight never say die attitude .come on..
XVRlNJxakqA,"LJ is an absolute baller
Come on Chelsea"
XVRlNJxakqA,1st save from Chelsea....goalkeeper position isn't ok..it's not a goal..
XVRlNJxakqA,Penalty?
XVRlNJxakqA,What a matchüòÆ
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren is such a baller man. Just like her brother Reecey
XVRlNJxakqA,its not penalty come on broü§£
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm a chelsea fans , it wasn't a penalty for really"
XVRlNJxakqA,Is this football? This is comedy. James was the only person on the pitch coming close to football.
XVRlNJxakqA,I'm just here for AKB's knee slide celebration
XVRlNJxakqA,"Barcelona about to win this year, great Job by Chelsea"
XVRlNJxakqA,"with lyon out, barcelona most likely will win it or i should say strong favourites"
XVRlNJxakqA,What a moment! what a match! COYB Great job ladies.
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon were robbed that was never a pen
XVRlNJxakqA,"This is far better exciting,tense and interesting than watching the men's  chelsea team"
XVRlNJxakqA,The women‚Äôs Chelsea should trade places with the masculine team !
XVRlNJxakqA,"This is so unfair, the goalkeeper must remain with both of her feets on the goal line at the time of execution of the penalty, thing that she didn't , I'm not fan of any of this teams but gotta say"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Disappointing mistake by the Lyon player in the box, she didn't need to go for a tackle as another Lyon defender (Carpenter I think) had it covered, there would've been a corner kick at best"
XVRlNJxakqA,If it was milli bright in place of ericksson we won't even concede those two goals
XVRlNJxakqA,That wasn't a penalty. VAR just wants Chelsea to win.
XVRlNJxakqA,Boehly pays VAR
XVRlNJxakqA,Cool to see Lauren James is also doing well.
XVRlNJxakqA,that gk celebration at the end lol
XVRlNJxakqA,Emma must do something with those 2 Centre Back. A lot of mistakes on defense. Whatta game! My heart's almost stop beating.
XVRlNJxakqA,This is CHELSEA! We will go against the 2 most important teams in Spain (men and women)
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea got outplayed over the two legs. But the best team doesn't always win. *shrug*
XVRlNJxakqA,"What a Game
 Between Che vs OLy üò±üî•üî•üî•"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea üíô
XVRlNJxakqA,That's the lightest pen i seen i a while.
XVRlNJxakqA,The Chelsea keeper is actually better than kepa
XVRlNJxakqA,ann-katrin berger. incredible saves on that penalty shootout. well deserved Chelsea üëè
XVRlNJxakqA,"I like Chelsea, but Chelsea women did not deserve to go through."
XVRlNJxakqA,How come the goalkeeper was allowed to step out of the line before the kick was taken. The saves would have been retaken.
XVRlNJxakqA,"Vamos Barca 
Barca will win the uwcl üéâ"
XVRlNJxakqA,How can Laura James tripping herself be a penalty. There was no contact with her by the lyon player. Lyon have been robbed big time. The ref and VAR needs medicine for thier glaucoma. üò°üò°
XVRlNJxakqA,Fair play to chelsea but that was a soft penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üí™
XVRlNJxakqA,So English goalkeepers are allowed to leave the line before the penalty is kicked. I didn't know about this specific rule.
XVRlNJxakqA,VAR corruption at its best
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm so glad Lyon is out xD. But to be fair... in the PK shootout, Chelsea's goal keeper got in front of the goal line way before the kicker take the shot, both penalties should have been repeated in today's rules."
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon won many times let the rest pls üòÇüòÇüòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,DIDNT KNOW THE CHELSEA OWNER OLD TODD IS ALSO THE WOMANS MANAGER LOL
XVRlNJxakqA,Magdalena Erikson destroyer the game
XVRlNJxakqA,7:53 Did she not step out of line too early??
XVRlNJxakqA,Erikson time at the Bridge is over
XVRlNJxakqA,This game was rigged this is robbery to Lyon
XVRlNJxakqA,playing bunch of sissies
XVRlNJxakqA,They are going to need a lot more than VAR cheat code against Barcelona Femeni thou.. Infact they shud just let the Male team play the semis üòÇüòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,"LYON WAS ROBBED!!! THAT'S NOT A PENALTY IN A THOUSAND LIFETIMES....
MAFIAAAAAAA"
XVRlNJxakqA,UP THE CHELS! COYB
XVRlNJxakqA,"Chelsea fc ladies was never really in the match in the second half and extra time until that penalty,it was just like a miracle for Chelsea to get that penalty out of nothing."
XVRlNJxakqA,I'm glad both french teams we're defeated.
XVRlNJxakqA,bruh what a game.
XVRlNJxakqA,Erickson was really poor
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon comfortably the better side. Barca will batter Chelsea in the SF.
XVRlNJxakqA,Why weren‚Äôt the rest of the players around the box for the penalty in the last min?
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren and Reece definitely trained a lot together growing up. They mirror each other in style
XVRlNJxakqA,Let‚Äôs go chelsea
XVRlNJxakqA,Poor play by womensüòÖüòÖüòÖ
XVRlNJxakqA,"Keeper off her line for every pen, how could that not be looked at? Makes no sense"
XVRlNJxakqA,That was not a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,No way that‚Äôs a penüíÄüíÄ
XVRlNJxakqA,The robbery of the century at Stamford Bridge. The referee saw the penalty when they gave her the money. Corrupt Chelsea buying referees.
XVRlNJxakqA,I stopped watching the game with less than 2 mins to end extra time only to later find on the Chelsea women's page on Instagram that Chelsea were through to the semis. Imagine my shock and dumbfounded face
XVRlNJxakqA,"On penalties, the Chelsea goalkeeper takes the lead before kick-off. Why wasn't that sanctioned?"
XVRlNJxakqA,The referee is a ü§°Chelsea üí©üí©üí©ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
XVRlNJxakqA,That wasn‚Äôt a pen. James dived üòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,Lets. Do this
XVRlNJxakqA,She tripped on her own leg.
XVRlNJxakqA,Gowan the blues üíô
XVRlNJxakqA,An absolute ridiculous penalty. Cheating in women's football too?
XVRlNJxakqA,"My favorite color . BLue is on the top.of Champion leauge. Blue lion of London. Great Blues, great roar.‚ù§"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Only Chelsea women team care about the club. Thats all I need to know. 
Attitude, passion, mentality, desire. 
Nobody cares about the men's team"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea's captain is not so fantastic tonight.
XVRlNJxakqA,"Happy Chelsea won, but Eriksson seems to be getting worse as the games go on this year. Just one bad decision after another."
XVRlNJxakqA,An Instant classic
XVRlNJxakqA,Is it a penalty that simulation?????? ü§îü§îü§îü§î I think no!
XVRlNJxakqA,Couldn‚Äôt believe it and if we can beat Lyon Women than we can do anything while beating PSG Women twice in the group stage let‚Äôs go blues
XVRlNJxakqA,The girls showing how its done. Now its up to the men¬¥s team vs. real to replicate it.
XVRlNJxakqA,"That was a ridiculous, absurd penalty call on Lyon in the last minute of the match. VAR stole the match from the French team. That was in no way a penalty---beyond soft. Disgraceful call. Chelsea did not deserve to win that match."
XVRlNJxakqA,The penalty is a joke ! Scandalous
XVRlNJxakqA,"BLATANT CHEATING 
  We all know"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Women PremierLrague best league in Europe, Barcellona is the strongest team, but nobody have 4 teams Chelsea,Arsenal,United,City from quarterfinals/semifinals of WUCL"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Right now, Iam so proud of the club #upthechels #ChelseaFC #championsofeurope"
XVRlNJxakqA,The penalty wasn't a penalty....as usual the Brits cheat...
XVRlNJxakqA,Yes chelsea. Come on you blues!!!! üéâ
XVRlNJxakqA,I would never have believed it if someone told me in 2023 I‚Äôd be supporting the women‚Äôs CHELS more than the men‚Äôs
XVRlNJxakqA,"Highway robbery, one of the softest penalties ever. A great injustice has been done to Lyon!!"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea need to be investigated for paying the VAR people and the ref Lauren trips up on her own leg and it wasn't a clear and obvious error
XVRlNJxakqA,Happy for Women football
XVRlNJxakqA,Erikson could've done better to prevent those two goals. She has been a bit of a liability as of late
XVRlNJxakqA,That was not a penalty what a awful decision
XVRlNJxakqA,I understand the significance and I understand that players are human and people too but I was surprised that horan cried at the end knowing how many big tournaments she‚Äôs been in and how experienced she is
XVRlNJxakqA,THAT penalty is a SHAME üò°üò°
XVRlNJxakqA,"Bye bye olympique de madrid, thx Chelsea, this champions going to barcelona üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ"
XVRlNJxakqA,How are people saying that‚Äôs not a penalty? She makes contact with James‚Äô leg which then makes her go down. Literally a stone wall penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,What a save that is to win it üôèüèº
XVRlNJxakqA,What an incredible game
XVRlNJxakqA,"Shameful refereeing decisions - no penalty for Chelsea in e.t., and both saves on the penalties shot out must be retaken because the Chelsea goalkeeper moves from the line before the shot."
XVRlNJxakqA,That was not penalty üòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,How can the officials not see that the Chelsea keeper is a yard off her line when the penalty kicks are taken? Admittedly she has to go the right way to be in a position to make the save but it makes a complete mockery of the penalty shootout.
XVRlNJxakqA,Congratulations to the whole Chelsea fan
XVRlNJxakqA,"That's not a penalty for every touch, the referee was right. VAR is just making it worse."
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon was robbed. Chelsea are cheaters. I hope they get knocked out of the tournament.
XVRlNJxakqA,How was that a pen
XVRlNJxakqA,"120+2mins and the boys are losing, will they ever make it through just like the girls with? with Harry Potter in charge ?????üòä"
XVRlNJxakqA,Is this the sister of chelseas James?
XVRlNJxakqA,Why didn't you show all of the penalties?
XVRlNJxakqA,Great game blues
XVRlNJxakqA,They fought well...deserved it ‚úåüèæ
XVRlNJxakqA,They are better penalty taker than the mens team üëèüèº
XVRlNJxakqA,Brilliant penalty save to win it
XVRlNJxakqA,Leupolz  take care  ‚ù§üí™üèª my best wishes
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James will surely bounce back from the missed penalty and become even more dominant.
XVRlNJxakqA,I don‚Äôt agree with the penalty decision but what a finish ü§©
XVRlNJxakqA,No pen reff fvkin terrible
XVRlNJxakqA,Well done Chelsea !
XVRlNJxakqA,My girls will never let me down! I am so proud!
XVRlNJxakqA,What a match üíôü§çüî•
XVRlNJxakqA,What a game!! I had to say I didn't expect it!!
XVRlNJxakqA,We don‚Äôt need the VAR ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
XVRlNJxakqA,This is the golden age for women‚Äôs football in England for certain for clubs and country
XVRlNJxakqA,Came back to this and I want to say Lauren James is a brilliant player
XVRlNJxakqA,March 28 im here in emma hayes we trust
XVRlNJxakqA,"The person with the highest score in this match is Danielle Van de Donk.
A completely different game from the first half, Lyon needs to understand the value of the bright Dutch star. Chelsea players didn't even have the desired passes with DvD's smart play and high pressing!"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Its not penalty.
Anyway, congrats chelsea"
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren gameplay like Reece üíô
XVRlNJxakqA,The Best team lose
XVRlNJxakqA,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ they are so funny
XVRlNJxakqA,Nice extended highlights ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
XVRlNJxakqA,Anybody help me with the name of the comentator please
XVRlNJxakqA,"But honestly, was this really the best thumbnail pic you could think of for this clip?! I mean, just look at that hand placement..."
XVRlNJxakqA,"The Chelsea goalkeeper illegally overtakes in the 2 penalties she saved. I don't know if in the female the rule in penalties is the same as in the male. The referee was very weak, she didn't see the overtaking, she didn't see the penalty at minute 120, they had to warn her about the var and the backhand that they gave Melanie Leupolz who had to leave due to the endless bleeding she had from her nose didn't see it either."
XVRlNJxakqA,Am a Chelsea fan but that first assist and goal from Lyon ladies was sweet.
XVRlNJxakqA,Bravo....am happy for my club
XVRlNJxakqA,"The one that took the penalty, then stepped up first in the shootout has massive balls under pressure"
XVRlNJxakqA,"No penalty, no way thats a penalty, ex ref."
XVRlNJxakqA,Out make team will also knockout the make champions league holders Real Madrid
XVRlNJxakqA,Jessie Fleming stepping up for a PK for Chelsea ..... reminded me instantly of the Japan Summer Olympics. (Does she ever miss a PK?)
XVRlNJxakqA,"Nice saves, those goalkeepers are top notch in the women's league"
XVRlNJxakqA,Maybe the men can take a bit from this.
XVRlNJxakqA,All the people that watched the match but stopped at 120 mins should be watching the replay after every match. Imagine that it was after you left watching that they won.
XVRlNJxakqA,It was dramatic match.
XVRlNJxakqA,I love Chelsea from Thailand
XVRlNJxakqA,For me it's the Drogba run buy the goal keeperüòÖü•áüèÜüíØüí™üáØüá≤üôåüèøüôÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,"All the males you see here,we're forced to come by their girlfriends"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Real Madrid be like: nah Lyon Feminin is too weak, let us teach Chelsea a lesson."
XVRlNJxakqA,That's not a penalty for Chelsea woman.
XVRlNJxakqA,"As usual . Anyone plays against a British team and referees begin whistling as referees to Barcelona in la Liga. Only time is was right was the final of 66 . But after everything divided is always on the bit team (as if Europe is  a colony of UK and they have to have always the benefit. I'm not a fan o Lyon or Chelsea . ""se got clicked"" and you are blind .  There are a lot of games where brit players hit even harder and you guys ignore it or play nothing happend."
XVRlNJxakqA,"Eriksson is a liability in that defence.

I can't wait for Millie Bright to be back, so she's dropped to the bench."
XVRlNJxakqA,why were lyon so mad about the pk>? what were they complaining about>?
XVRlNJxakqA,"Lots of comments about the last-gasp penalty for Chelsea. Of course there is contact but James leans into her opponent to create it. The defender does not make a tackle at all, she just ""jockeys"". Not a penalty in my view. Chelsea so, so lucky."
XVRlNJxakqA,missed the clip of leupolz getting her head bashed in this game was literally war out there it had everything
XVRlNJxakqA,YNWA ..well done Chelsea..
XVRlNJxakqA,I am a Chelsea fan and that wasn't a penalty. She kicked herself.
XVRlNJxakqA,Very generous penalty! Lyon played better and deserved to win
XVRlNJxakqA,"Women Football Grown like wow

What a game KTBFFH üíôüíôüíô"
XVRlNJxakqA,I thought Lyon would have gone through with away goals
XVRlNJxakqA,When did Chelsea score their second goal?
XVRlNJxakqA,Did anyone come here jus to see Melanie Leupolz injury‚Ä¶I mean I really don‚Äôt see why another reason why to‚Ä¶ women‚Äôs football hella boring ü•±
XVRlNJxakqA,"Jessie Fleming also scored a Penalty, not shown... ü§î"
XVRlNJxakqA,Joke of a penalty lol
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea penalty isn't deserve I think for me as Chelsea fans but this kind of case type is usually happen at least we've going to semi finals üòÅ
XVRlNJxakqA,What a game!!!!
XVRlNJxakqA,Clear and obvious error?
XVRlNJxakqA,How is that a pen üòÇ. Getting level with the mens game I guess with shocking VAR calls
XVRlNJxakqA,"That Chelsea lady knows how to take a penalty. Unlike Neymar and other ""experts""."
XVRlNJxakqA,How is this a penalty?
XVRlNJxakqA,Kepa definitely trained Berger on penalties
XVRlNJxakqA,Hey
XVRlNJxakqA,"Soft one, but she was clipped"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea üîµ
XVRlNJxakqA,Superb by Chelsea
XVRlNJxakqA,Best womens match I‚Äôve seen so far by far
XVRlNJxakqA,So women goalkeepers are allowed to come off their line in penalties but men aren‚Äôt? Is that a rule now is it?
XVRlNJxakqA,Seriously poor quality
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James and his brother Reece are amazing players
XVRlNJxakqA,Congratulations our Chelsea ladies
XVRlNJxakqA,Hope the boys can do it
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James cheated at the end to get that penalty !!!!  OL LYON did the job !
XVRlNJxakqA,That was nice to watch #CFC
XVRlNJxakqA,Great game! Turn down the Vol on the commentator!!
XVRlNJxakqA,Recce James must teach her sister how to take spots
XVRlNJxakqA,"When you can't win, you cheat, nicely done James, what a player, what a diver ! ü§£"
XVRlNJxakqA,Incredible game but Chelsea is lucky. Well done but Barcelona will crush them next round. 0 chance to get the final. Chelsea is an old version of kick & rush.
XVRlNJxakqA,It's an outrage‚Ää !
XVRlNJxakqA,Was never a penalty. Referees seem to give English teams penalties all the time now. Its become very predictable
XVRlNJxakqA,Surely each save was off the line? Chelsea fan here btw but the last pen was 6yr box üòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,"Vamos Barca , thank you Chelsea for KO the French champ , who‚Äôs always a hurdle for Barca in UCL .My vote goes to Barca to win UCL.Chelsea deserves it today .Superb Game ."
XVRlNJxakqA,That‚Äôs not a pen!!!
XVRlNJxakqA,That's not penalty!.. Lyon was robbed!
XVRlNJxakqA,I love Lauren James but that was not really a Penalty. She just threw herself down ro get a Penalty. The first Penalty for Lyon was supposed to be retaken because The Chelsea Goalkeeper came out of her line before the Penalty was Kicked. Why not use the same rules in Women's Soccer football as they are used in Men's?
XVRlNJxakqA,"Well done, but the case for Equal pay, I don't think so if this is the top quality football on show, then there is a very long way to go in Quality. But very well done in getting to the semi-finals Ladies."
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James really need to work on her shooting accuracy
XVRlNJxakqA,Great fight and determination! Well done Chelsea Ladies !
XVRlNJxakqA,"Despite the qualified Chelsea hardly spring passes together last night 
And I was so annoyed...
Congratulations to them though"
XVRlNJxakqA,My Queens!
XVRlNJxakqA,That was not the penalty!! Corrupted UEFA!!!
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea no7 is absolutely useless
XVRlNJxakqA,Goalies off their line every kick ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
XVRlNJxakqA,"xG of James estimated: 5% 
xG of Penalty estimated: 70% 
Yes. There might be some touch on her leg. But do we really want that worth of an almost sure goal?
VAR has solve some problems. But it has created other ones in exchange."
XVRlNJxakqA,Heart break
XVRlNJxakqA,"Congratulations Ladies best Chelsea game to watch all year,Emma how about coaching the men's team as well üòä"
XVRlNJxakqA,Soft PK to call.. but congratulations on beating the champs
XVRlNJxakqA,I wish they showed the last penalty from down the end line. It looked suspiciously like the keeper‚Äôs feet were off the line but from our angle you can‚Äôt tell.
XVRlNJxakqA,"chelsea  keeper one the 2 penalties was fault  , she move forward of the line amazing the referee didn't call"
XVRlNJxakqA,Come on Chelsea!!
XVRlNJxakqA,"The penalty came from a fall in terrupting his own leg.
 Referees look at var why
 I now watch more women's football than mens football James dived clearly although cheering for James in the England nation team"
XVRlNJxakqA,Why was there no players on the edge of the box when the penalty was taken at the end of extra time ?
XVRlNJxakqA,My only wish is we have full squad fit against Barca.
XVRlNJxakqA,If that was a penalty then every game would be filled with penalties
XVRlNJxakqA,what a frigging game
XVRlNJxakqA,i thought keepers were supposed to stay on their line
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea Capt needs to defend well against Barca or else they'll be thrashed
XVRlNJxakqA,Are we gonna see a all London Final?
XVRlNJxakqA,How was that a penalty Lyon was robbed
XVRlNJxakqA,"That was a very soft penalty and a really poor and costly decision by the referee. Believe it or not, contact IS allowed in football. üôÑ"
XVRlNJxakqA,"so you clip your own leg, fall over and the ref gives a penalty-worse then the mens game-cheating and diving"
XVRlNJxakqA,Up up the Blues üí™üèæüíôüíôüíô
XVRlNJxakqA,Not being funny but my 14 year old nephew could of saved that second lyon goal üôà
XVRlNJxakqA,Up the Chels!!
XVRlNJxakqA,That was never a penalty James tripped herself up
XVRlNJxakqA,Leo deserved win
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea Chelsea Chelsea üíôüíôüíô
XVRlNJxakqA,"Erikson and Kaloubaly have similar playing styles in terms of errors, miss kicks and wrong decision wise üòÇ Todd should buy Maria Leon from Barca üòä with those kind of errors, we're lucky to win . Sam Kerr should stop wasting 1v1 chances ; composer is required to burry those chances"
XVRlNJxakqA,I stopped watching after Lyons second goal. went back and it was penalty shootout and I couldn't believe it. What happened in 15minü§îI'm proud of my ladiesüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíô
XVRlNJxakqA,Emma Hayes should replace potter
XVRlNJxakqA,That wasn't even a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,Stamford Bridge is one special place üò¢
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea goal keeper is the man of the match üòç
XVRlNJxakqA,What a game. I dont usually watch womens footy but i will now. Wow.
XVRlNJxakqA,I thought penalty controversy only happened in male football. üòÅ Coz that was nowhere a penalty.
XVRlNJxakqA,The James siblings‚òÄ‚òÄüåü
XVRlNJxakqA,That Lyon defender is dumb. No need to touch james
XVRlNJxakqA,Why 120 min??
XVRlNJxakqA,Intensive game. What a game from the ladies.
XVRlNJxakqA,Never a pen
XVRlNJxakqA,"Ashamed. Imaginary penalty, Lyon was robbed by arbitration. What is VAR for?"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Chelsea has to play at Aston Villa Sunday.
They'll be worn out and sore.

Aston Villa isn't going to win a top 3 spot this season but they're going to wreck some dreams."
XVRlNJxakqA,That last minute penalty was definitely not a pen üòÇüòÇüòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,"Never a penalty, she felt some contact then put her foot back to be clipped. Clever, but depressing."
XVRlNJxakqA,That is bad refereeing
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James is world Class. Lauren James is world Class. Lauren James is world Class. Lauren James is world Class.
XVRlNJxakqA,what a game
XVRlNJxakqA,wait can someone explain why the players werent surrounding the box for mjelde's penalty in extra time
XVRlNJxakqA,"Well done ladies, you make you‚Äôre own luck but class is class."
XVRlNJxakqA,"To be fair, that was no way a penalty!! 
According to this ref, any sort of touch is foul"
XVRlNJxakqA,"The Lionesses legacy continues with two English teams into the last four of the Champions League. Congratulations Chelsea. It was a 12 round chess match where both team frustrated each other. Fantastic to see Potter, James and a few others from the men‚Äôs team supporting their teammates. Hope Leupolz is ok."
XVRlNJxakqA,It‚Äôs an inescapable fact that the Chelsea player dived for the penalty. Even the most biased supporter sees that.
XVRlNJxakqA,Scandalous‚Ä¶how far off her line is the Chelsea keeper on these penalties‚Ä¶as for Lauren James what a diving cheat‚Ä¶shame on you.
XVRlNJxakqA,"Well done Chelsea Women amazing stuff but terribly edited highlights. Chopping off commentary all over the place , poor cross fades and Lyon Women‚Äôs second penalty is missing. So confusing to watch. Come on Dazn, you‚Äôre better than this"
XVRlNJxakqA,"NEVER A PENALTY-NEVER. I don't think there was even any contact but if there was, the Chelsea striker has been waiting for a TINY touch & cheated via diving-pathetic. STOP WATCHING THE MEN'S GAME GIRLS!!! The commentators all forget it is a contact sport & contact is allowed in the rules of the game."
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon missed a lot of chances
XVRlNJxakqA,This penalty a shame
XVRlNJxakqA,"Commentator, you can be excited you know you've just witnessed a 128th minute equaliser in a champions league quarter final and she sounds like she's just watched her cat die"
XVRlNJxakqA,Y the penalty when it‚Äôs 2:1
XVRlNJxakqA,"It wasn't a lucky day for Erickssen, our skipper"
XVRlNJxakqA,The chelsea Keeper for women is better than Kepa in Penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,That wasn‚Äôt a penalty but congrats to chelsea üëèüèø
XVRlNJxakqA,the women football is like when you start master league and all your players run slower and shoot like they pass...
XVRlNJxakqA,How is no one talking about Lauren James? Such a great player! what a player?
XVRlNJxakqA,How was that a pen üòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,Crazy UCL night at the bridge what do you expect üéâ
XVRlNJxakqA,James was unplayable üí•üí•
XVRlNJxakqA,"How was that penalty given üòÇüòÇ, sooooo soft."
XVRlNJxakqA,"We kinda played bad ngl
I expect more from eriksson"
XVRlNJxakqA,There's no penalty at the end of the game. What a robbery...
XVRlNJxakqA,Question is: who cares?
XVRlNJxakqA,"ok, fair play to chelsea for getting through but i thought they left too many gaps in midfield & could have been destroyed only for Lyon were off their game, they will be annihilated by Barcelona if they do that in semis, plus the Lyon first penno miss should have been retaken as the keeper came way off her line, but look its done now so they have to focus on the nxt game"
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm glad Chelsea got through but with both Chelsea saves it did look like the keeper was off her line. I didn't see the penalties live, just this footage."
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm a Chelsea fan and I love the women team so much as they have been the joy of Chelsea fans this season. That being said, that was not a penalty. And if they don't play better, Barcelona women will blow them away...........the penalty take Mjelde was cool as ice"
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon deserved to win but it was a foolish challenge by Becho and it cost them dearly...  And even Lyon would've struggled against Barcelona in the semi's.  Chelsea have even less of a chance but an upset is always possible.
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren and Reece are TRUE jems of this club... even mason mount... proper chels
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'll admit that I stopped watching at the 119th minute, what little faith I have! Well-done you superb Chelsea ladies!"
XVRlNJxakqA,I'm happy for our keeper's input during the shootouts but not during the open-play.
XVRlNJxakqA,"Never a pen tbh, nevertheless Bar√ßa is waiting üòà"
XVRlNJxakqA,The best club üôáüíÅü¶Åüíô
XVRlNJxakqA,Never a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James is special. What a player üíØüíØüî•üî•
XVRlNJxakqA,That was no penalty...
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm sorry but Erikson makes me nervous. She doesn't convince me one bit. I can't believe she's the captain. She makes so many mistakes. That first goal of Lyon, she was ball watching and doesn't mark the 1st post. Second Lyon goal was also her fault. She failed to position herself well to be able to clear the ball. I wish Bright will be back for the semis. Erikson is too raw for me, I'm sorry. Chelsea should consider getting another Buchanan to back Bright."
XVRlNJxakqA,I fall in  love we this Chelsea women's
XVRlNJxakqA,But how was that a pen ??
XVRlNJxakqA,great game on both team
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James; Chelsea's engine
XVRlNJxakqA,"Ericsson tried to bottle it up for Chelsea,Bright was missed,Lauren James is our best player this season,Mjelda and Carter all had a wonderful night,Berger is the hero of the night"
XVRlNJxakqA,shame on Chelsea with an imagineray penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,"Chelsea keeper came off her line before Lyon players struck the ball for both penalties saved at the end, should have been retaken."
XVRlNJxakqA,"What the Men can do, the Women can do better"
XVRlNJxakqA,How the tables turn at the last minute. Holding the ball inside the penalty area and hoping someone fouls you can change a whole game
XVRlNJxakqA,I was crying üò≠‚Ä¶. But happy
XVRlNJxakqA,Ericsson almost did 2 big mistakes on both legs üòÖüòÖüòÖ
XVRlNJxakqA,"Berger, Frohms, Grohs, and in the last years Schult, Angerer, Rottenberg... Germany has the greatest GK on earth without any doubt!"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea is massive! üîµ
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea with ANOTHER robberyüíÄ
XVRlNJxakqA,James has a future in acting... Chelsea has the most players who take the best penalty kicks!
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea fan but that was no penalty. She should be auditioning in Hollywood.
XVRlNJxakqA,First penalty wasn¬¥t correct  !!!
XVRlNJxakqA,That soft penalty robbery really üòÇüòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,Can't wait for the World Cup...watching how great all these players are so far....its awesome!
XVRlNJxakqA,"But Chelsea need to work on defence , everything is okay"
XVRlNJxakqA,She's gonna win ballodor if she plays like this and by the help of her teammates
XVRlNJxakqA,Same old Chelsea always cheating
XVRlNJxakqA,wasn't a penalty though
XVRlNJxakqA,That's not a penalty. And the Chelsea keeper goes out of the line. It's should have been a retake
XVRlNJxakqA,And Where is The penalty?
XVRlNJxakqA,Wow...... infact I gave up on the ladies and stopped watching when the second goal went in. I woke up only this morning seeing a pop up on my phone about the result. Great win from my Blue Ladies.... well done. üíôüëåüíô
XVRlNJxakqA,"Love this channel..
Your highlights are always clear"
XVRlNJxakqA,Do they not check the keeper coming off the line for penalties in the woman‚Äôs game?
XVRlNJxakqA,The last penalty rule violation by Berger..So Chelsea didn't deserve.
XVRlNJxakqA,Nobody talking about the terrible penalty decision that ruined the whole tie?
XVRlNJxakqA,We‚Äôve all Withness something last nightüòÇüòÇüòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,"Thanks for showing these great games freely, DAZN."
XVRlNJxakqA,Wmns champion league is getting better and better
XVRlNJxakqA,"a game where defences & midfield ruled, cuthbert & Van da donk, Buccanan & Renard were all brilliant"
XVRlNJxakqA,"I was literally so sad in in last 2 mins had no hope but then Lauren got clipped. VAR you know what that means, pen. I WAS SCARED for my life. The way we scored that pen was cool. World class. And the fact that we won on penalties, I can call this best game of tournament so far. I was delighted"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Lauren will get better and better, shes a beast wallahi ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ"
XVRlNJxakqA,That is no where near a penalty haha shocking decision absolutely
XVRlNJxakqA,"Also the last Lyon s penalty, Chelsea goalkeeper left her line early ........."
XVRlNJxakqA,At this point we need to transfer some of these women to the men's team... üíôüíôüíôLOVE THE SPIRIT..COYB
XVRlNJxakqA,That penalty in xtra time isnt a penalty tho
XVRlNJxakqA,I am happy there are fans supporting them in this game. Congratulations to both sides for having amazing fans. Entertaining game had us on the edge of our seat. The late drama is just typical champions league spirit üòä. Nice to see this kind of scene in women's game.
XVRlNJxakqA,The celebrating for lyons first goalüòÇüòÇüòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,"The last minute , are you sure penalty for Chelsea ? 
I think is not penalty üòÇ"
XVRlNJxakqA,Never a penalty though
XVRlNJxakqA,No penalty lol
XVRlNJxakqA,"Lauren James is world class, world class!"
XVRlNJxakqA,Ucl at stamford bridge just hits different üíô
XVRlNJxakqA,What a rediculous penalty decision in minute 120. The referees seem to like Chelsea in international gamesüí∏
XVRlNJxakqA,Never a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea will be destroyed by Barcelona 22 April üòé
XVRlNJxakqA,Cuthbert is the N'golo Kante of the ladies team. She was a monster in that midfield
XVRlNJxakqA,"Chelsea got a nice present with that 90+2 ""penalty""..."
XVRlNJxakqA,The Chelsea  captain is the weak link in the defence I have watched many matches were she gives away silly balls that lead to goal......
XVRlNJxakqA,"That penalty by Mjelde was on another level compared to the last few penalties taken by havertz. She was so calm and composed. Havertz on the other side, misses his first penalty after beoming the main penalty taker since jorghinos departure. Luckily he got to retake it."
XVRlNJxakqA,Don't goallies have to stay on their line until pens are taken in the women's game?
XVRlNJxakqA,Who is that Chelsea's number 16?   Worst player on the pitch. What a disaster.
XVRlNJxakqA,Best match in the competition so far. Intensity and quality all round.
XVRlNJxakqA,"I that Barcelona were the once who is paying ref, but I was wrong, how is that a penalty?ü§£üòÇ"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea captain is useless
XVRlNJxakqA,I turned it off at 2 minutes into injury time extra time and only just found out that they did give that penalty.
XVRlNJxakqA,WHAT A GAME! PROUD OF THE BLUES
XVRlNJxakqA,Fkin VAR saved us tbh
XVRlNJxakqA,"no penalty for me, James were searching the contact, see how the left leg bends to the right to the defender...."
XVRlNJxakqA,This James's family was born for footfall‚ù§
XVRlNJxakqA,Sam kerr is a magic for chelsea
XVRlNJxakqA,i dont like that 120min var decision to give a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,"So much drama at the end of this match! And heartbreaking to see Horan crying after the penalty save. 
May the best teams get through to the final!"
XVRlNJxakqA,Erikson making such huge mistakes twice  and costing the team üò¢
XVRlNJxakqA,"üòÇüòÇüòÇ whats, pinalty???"
XVRlNJxakqA,"If we can overcome Barca, we will win it."
XVRlNJxakqA,So proud of Chelsea tonight never say die attitude .come on..
XVRlNJxakqA,"LJ is an absolute baller
Come on Chelsea"
XVRlNJxakqA,1st save from Chelsea....goalkeeper position isn't ok..it's not a goal..
XVRlNJxakqA,Penalty?
XVRlNJxakqA,What a matchüòÆ
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren is such a baller man. Just like her brother Reecey
XVRlNJxakqA,its not penalty come on broü§£
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm a chelsea fans , it wasn't a penalty for really"
XVRlNJxakqA,Is this football? This is comedy. James was the only person on the pitch coming close to football.
XVRlNJxakqA,I'm just here for AKB's knee slide celebration
XVRlNJxakqA,"Barcelona about to win this year, great Job by Chelsea"
XVRlNJxakqA,"with lyon out, barcelona most likely will win it or i should say strong favourites"
XVRlNJxakqA,What a moment! what a match! COYB Great job ladies.
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon were robbed that was never a pen
XVRlNJxakqA,Funny penalty given
XVRlNJxakqA,"This is far better exciting,tense and interesting than watching the men's  chelsea team"
XVRlNJxakqA,They look like u 10 hahahahahaha woman gets more then the man thats totally fair...hahahahaha
XVRlNJxakqA,Clear diveüòÇüòÇüòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,The women‚Äôs Chelsea should trade places with the masculine team !
XVRlNJxakqA,"This is so unfair, the goalkeeper must remain with both of her feets on the goal line at the time of execution of the penalty, thing that she didn't , I'm not fan of any of this teams but gotta say"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Disappointing mistake by the Lyon player in the box, she didn't need to go for a tackle as another Lyon defender (Carpenter I think) had it covered, there would've been a corner kick at best"
XVRlNJxakqA,If it was milli bright in place of ericksson we won't even concede those two goals
XVRlNJxakqA,not foullll . not penalty chuakzzz
XVRlNJxakqA,That wasn't a penalty. VAR just wants Chelsea to win.
XVRlNJxakqA,Boehly pays VAR
XVRlNJxakqA,Cool to see Lauren James is also doing well.
XVRlNJxakqA,that gk celebration at the end lol
XVRlNJxakqA,Emma must do something with those 2 Centre Back. A lot of mistakes on defense. Whatta game! My heart's almost stop beating.
XVRlNJxakqA,This is CHELSEA! We will go against the 2 most important teams in Spain (men and women)
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea got outplayed over the two legs. But the best team doesn't always win. *shrug*
XVRlNJxakqA,"What a Game
 Between Che vs OLy üò±üî•üî•üî•"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea üíô
XVRlNJxakqA,That's the lightest pen i seen i a while.
XVRlNJxakqA,The Chelsea keeper is actually better than kepa
XVRlNJxakqA,ann-katrin berger. incredible saves on that penalty shootout. well deserved Chelsea üëè
XVRlNJxakqA,"I like Chelsea, but Chelsea women did not deserve to go through."
XVRlNJxakqA,How come the goalkeeper was allowed to step out of the line before the kick was taken. The saves would have been retaken.
XVRlNJxakqA,"Vamos Barca 
Barca will win the uwcl üéâ"
XVRlNJxakqA,How can Laura James tripping herself be a penalty. There was no contact with her by the lyon player. Lyon have been robbed big time. The ref and VAR needs medicine for thier glaucoma. üò°üò°
XVRlNJxakqA,Fair play to chelsea but that was a soft penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üí™
XVRlNJxakqA,So English goalkeepers are allowed to leave the line before the penalty is kicked. I didn't know about this specific rule.
XVRlNJxakqA,VAR corruption at its best
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm so glad Lyon is out xD. But to be fair... in the PK shootout, Chelsea's goal keeper got in front of the goal line way before the kicker take the shot, both penalties should have been repeated in today's rules."
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon won many times let the rest pls üòÇüòÇüòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,DIDNT KNOW THE CHELSEA OWNER OLD TODD IS ALSO THE WOMANS MANAGER LOL
XVRlNJxakqA,Magdalena Erikson destroyer the game
XVRlNJxakqA,7:53 Did she not step out of line too early??
XVRlNJxakqA,Erikson time at the Bridge is over
XVRlNJxakqA,This game was rigged this is robbery to Lyon
XVRlNJxakqA,playing bunch of sissies
XVRlNJxakqA,They are going to need a lot more than VAR cheat code against Barcelona Femeni thou.. Infact they shud just let the Male team play the semis üòÇüòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,"LYON WAS ROBBED!!! THAT'S NOT A PENALTY IN A THOUSAND LIFETIMES....
MAFIAAAAAAA"
XVRlNJxakqA,UP THE CHELS! COYB
XVRlNJxakqA,"Chelsea fc ladies was never really in the match in the second half and extra time until that penalty,it was just like a miracle for Chelsea to get that penalty out of nothing."
XVRlNJxakqA,I'm glad both french teams we're defeated.
XVRlNJxakqA,bruh what a game.
XVRlNJxakqA,Erickson was really poor
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon comfortably the better side. Barca will batter Chelsea in the SF.
XVRlNJxakqA,Why weren‚Äôt the rest of the players around the box for the penalty in the last min?
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren and Reece definitely trained a lot together growing up. They mirror each other in style
XVRlNJxakqA,Let‚Äôs go chelsea
XVRlNJxakqA,Poor play by womensüòÖüòÖüòÖ
XVRlNJxakqA,"Keeper off her line for every pen, how could that not be looked at? Makes no sense"
XVRlNJxakqA,That was not a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,No way that‚Äôs a penüíÄüíÄ
XVRlNJxakqA,The robbery of the century at Stamford Bridge. The referee saw the penalty when they gave her the money. Corrupt Chelsea buying referees.
XVRlNJxakqA,I stopped watching the game with less than 2 mins to end extra time only to later find on the Chelsea women's page on Instagram that Chelsea were through to the semis. Imagine my shock and dumbfounded face
XVRlNJxakqA,"On penalties, the Chelsea goalkeeper takes the lead before kick-off. Why wasn't that sanctioned?"
XVRlNJxakqA,The referee is a ü§°Chelsea üí©üí©üí©ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
XVRlNJxakqA,That wasn‚Äôt a pen. James dived üòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,Lets. Do this
XVRlNJxakqA,She tripped on her own leg.
XVRlNJxakqA,Gowan the blues üíô
XVRlNJxakqA,An absolute ridiculous penalty. Cheating in women's football too?
XVRlNJxakqA,"My favorite color . BLue is on the top.of Champion leauge. Blue lion of London. Great Blues, great roar.‚ù§"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Only Chelsea women team care about the club. Thats all I need to know. 
Attitude, passion, mentality, desire. 
Nobody cares about the men's team"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea's captain is not so fantastic tonight.
XVRlNJxakqA,"Happy Chelsea won, but Eriksson seems to be getting worse as the games go on this year. Just one bad decision after another."
XVRlNJxakqA,An Instant classic
XVRlNJxakqA,Is it a penalty that simulation?????? ü§îü§îü§îü§î I think no!
XVRlNJxakqA,Couldn‚Äôt believe it and if we can beat Lyon Women than we can do anything while beating PSG Women twice in the group stage let‚Äôs go blues
XVRlNJxakqA,The girls showing how its done. Now its up to the men¬¥s team vs. real to replicate it.
XVRlNJxakqA,"That was a ridiculous, absurd penalty call on Lyon in the last minute of the match. VAR stole the match from the French team. That was in no way a penalty---beyond soft. Disgraceful call. Chelsea did not deserve to win that match."
XVRlNJxakqA,The penalty is a joke ! Scandalous
XVRlNJxakqA,"BLATANT CHEATING 
  We all know"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Women PremierLrague best league in Europe, Barcellona is the strongest team, but nobody have 4 teams Chelsea,Arsenal,United,City from quarterfinals/semifinals of WUCL"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Right now, Iam so proud of the club #upthechels #ChelseaFC #championsofeurope"
XVRlNJxakqA,The penalty wasn't a penalty....as usual the Brits cheat...
XVRlNJxakqA,Yes chelsea. Come on you blues!!!! üéâ
XVRlNJxakqA,I would never have believed it if someone told me in 2023 I‚Äôd be supporting the women‚Äôs CHELS more than the men‚Äôs
XVRlNJxakqA,"Highway robbery, one of the softest penalties ever. A great injustice has been done to Lyon!!"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea need to be investigated for paying the VAR people and the ref Lauren trips up on her own leg and it wasn't a clear and obvious error
XVRlNJxakqA,Happy for Women football
XVRlNJxakqA,Erikson could've done better to prevent those two goals. She has been a bit of a liability as of late
XVRlNJxakqA,That was not a penalty what a awful decision
XVRlNJxakqA,I understand the significance and I understand that players are human and people too but I was surprised that horan cried at the end knowing how many big tournaments she‚Äôs been in and how experienced she is
XVRlNJxakqA,THAT penalty is a SHAME üò°üò°
XVRlNJxakqA,"Bye bye olympique de madrid, thx Chelsea, this champions going to barcelona üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ"
XVRlNJxakqA,How are people saying that‚Äôs not a penalty? She makes contact with James‚Äô leg which then makes her go down. Literally a stone wall penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,What a save that is to win it üôèüèº
XVRlNJxakqA,What an incredible game
XVRlNJxakqA,"Shameful refereeing decisions - no penalty for Chelsea in e.t., and both saves on the penalties shot out must be retaken because the Chelsea goalkeeper moves from the line before the shot."
XVRlNJxakqA,UEFA = corruption
XVRlNJxakqA,That was not penalty üòÇ
XVRlNJxakqA,How can the officials not see that the Chelsea keeper is a yard off her line when the penalty kicks are taken? Admittedly she has to go the right way to be in a position to make the save but it makes a complete mockery of the penalty shootout.
XVRlNJxakqA,Congratulations to the whole Chelsea fan
XVRlNJxakqA,"That's not a penalty for every touch, the referee was right. VAR is just making it worse."
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon was robbed. Chelsea are cheaters. I hope they get knocked out of the tournament.
XVRlNJxakqA,How was that a pen
XVRlNJxakqA,"120+2mins and the boys are losing, will they ever make it through just like the girls with? with Harry Potter in charge ?????üòä"
XVRlNJxakqA,Is this the sister of chelseas James?
XVRlNJxakqA,Why didn't you show all of the penalties?
XVRlNJxakqA,Great game blues
XVRlNJxakqA,They fought well...deserved it ‚úåüèæ
XVRlNJxakqA,They are better penalty taker than the mens team üëèüèº
XVRlNJxakqA,Brilliant penalty save to win it
XVRlNJxakqA,Leupolz  take care  ‚ù§üí™üèª my best wishes
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James will surely bounce back from the missed penalty and become even more dominant.
XVRlNJxakqA,I don‚Äôt agree with the penalty decision but what a finish ü§©
XVRlNJxakqA,No pen reff fvkin terrible
XVRlNJxakqA,Well done Chelsea !
XVRlNJxakqA,My girls will never let me down! I am so proud!
XVRlNJxakqA,What a match üíôü§çüî•
XVRlNJxakqA,What a game!! I had to say I didn't expect it!!
XVRlNJxakqA,We don‚Äôt need the VAR ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
XVRlNJxakqA,This is the golden age for women‚Äôs football in England for certain for clubs and country
LG601aTJ3Rw,"Neutral here. No penalty against Lyon üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. The 2 penalties stoped by Chelsea should not be counted, the goalkeeper is advancing from the line. ‚ùå‚ùå Incompetence from the referee and illegally robbed to Lyon."
LG601aTJ3Rw,I wanna build a time machine and go back to 1980 or whenever it was so I can stop penalty shootouts from being invented after that maybe try to do something about  AIDS too but only if I have some time left over
LG601aTJ3Rw,Football is dead. Call it VAR Football from now.
LG601aTJ3Rw,CROOKS !
LG601aTJ3Rw,The lads can learn from Chelsea‚Äôs penalties all top bins!!!
LG601aTJ3Rw,poor refering-never a penalty-fell over her own feet-pathetic
LG601aTJ3Rw,Straight robbery
LG601aTJ3Rw,The softest penalty I‚Äôve ever seen
LG601aTJ3Rw,"Before concluding its not a penalty,watch the video very well"
LG601aTJ3Rw,first time i've ever seen a goalkeeper do a kneeslide and it was lovelyüòÇ
LG601aTJ3Rw,"I dont know how no 15 become che captain. Make a lot of mistake. 

Before this, 2 goals against mancity also from her mistake.

Please manager use other option."
LG601aTJ3Rw,"It's a f*ing disgrace. Shame on James, shame on referees, shame on UEFA."
LG601aTJ3Rw,Penalti light‚Ä¶
LG601aTJ3Rw,Chelsea üôèüôè
LG601aTJ3Rw,"That Chelsea Keeper Berger and Lauren James kept them in this ,Kerr oughta scored from that chance she spurned judging from her pedigree,she almost cost Chelsea,but Chelsea left back needs to be orientated,all goals and most of the attack came from her flank,they might have discovered she's weak"
LG601aTJ3Rw,*No one's gonna continue taking this sport seriously if the refs keep clearly helping teams out. Not producing a fair game makes people lose interest*
LG601aTJ3Rw,6:05 *How is that even a penalty?? She tripped on her own foot if anything it should be a yellow for diving* üôÑü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
LG601aTJ3Rw,Clear penalty
LG601aTJ3Rw,"She trips over her own feet üòÇ , appalling decision."
LG601aTJ3Rw,"The game was clearly a penalty,Lyon has a direct with James leg while she have the opportunity to aim at the ball‚Ä¶ Thanks to VAR"
LG601aTJ3Rw,"It WAS a penalty , yes   I didnt look properly at first  I too, was like : nah, that ain a pen  Then, I seen the lower camera angles"
LG601aTJ3Rw,Too much mistakes from the Chelsea captain Erickson. Chelsea might have escaped it tonight but might not be so lucky against others. Lauren was awesome. Kerr really needs to do more. Emma needs to work on that defence. Credit to the team cos Lyon is not an easy team to beat especially in the champions league.
LG601aTJ3Rw,Chelsea women fc‚ù§
LG601aTJ3Rw,Shakey Captain...blue..!üò¢
LG601aTJ3Rw,Totally robbery how‚Äôs that a penalty üòÖ
LG601aTJ3Rw,"Disgraceful penalty call on Lyon by VAR/referee. It was absurd--beyond soft. A slight bump and she embellishes and you decide the match with that call? That match was stolen from Lyon, IMO. Terrible decision."
LG601aTJ3Rw,This penalty is a FCKing joke
LG601aTJ3Rw,Trip over your own feet and you get a penalty .???
LG601aTJ3Rw,That penalty call was atrocious. Like be for real. Chelsea did not deserve this. Lyon got robbed big time
LG601aTJ3Rw,I wonder the goal keeper was not on the line?
LG601aTJ3Rw,Chelsea need to be investigated for paying the VAR people and the ref Lauren trips up on her own leg and it wasn't a clear and obvious error
LG601aTJ3Rw,Penalty really what a awful descion
LG601aTJ3Rw,"I see lots lamenting about the Pk here. It happens to be in favour of chelsea last night, let them enjoy it. There's actually been times it was against them. That's the football we watch now VAR did the right thing It's always down to the refree to make the final call so i guess it was Chelsea lucky night. Goodluck to the remaining teams in the UCL"
LG601aTJ3Rw,Chelsea all time with a scandalous penalty... It ain't penalty in nowhere place ...
LG601aTJ3Rw,That was not a penalty
LG601aTJ3Rw,Lauren James is a baller and Reynard is a rock at defence.
LG601aTJ3Rw,Doesn't matter its going to be Barcelona v German team.
LG601aTJ3Rw,"Lyon was robbed, 5:50  no honest referee will said this was penalty...   Incredible.. 
Then 7:59 the goalkeeper step ahead before the penalty is kick..  that should be kick again. 
Well, Barcelona will need to apply justice and eliminate Chelsea  5-0 or more..   No referee will be able to save Chelsea against that."
LG601aTJ3Rw,Amazing penalty by Ref..
LG601aTJ3Rw,"The goalkeeper steps forward the line before the taker contacts the ball in both saved penalties, hence those should have been retaken"
LG601aTJ3Rw,Referee üíµüíµüíµüíµüíµ shame on you
LG601aTJ3Rw,That wasn't a penalty üòÖ
LG601aTJ3Rw,Where il the penalty üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
LG601aTJ3Rw,James had lost control of the ball.
LG601aTJ3Rw,"Barca women will take this champions league üòÇüòÇüòÇ bye, Chelsea will be knocked out in the next stage, that wasn‚Äôt a penalty"
LG601aTJ3Rw,"Disgusting pen, Chelsea totally bailed by the referee. They don't have the level for the semis, the other teams have been more consistent."
LG601aTJ3Rw,"Chelsea womens vs Lyon womens (8 titles record)
Chelsea vs real Madrid (14 titles record)"
LG601aTJ3Rw,The penalty is a false call‚Ä¶
LG601aTJ3Rw,This is awesome‚Ä¶
LG601aTJ3Rw,How is that a penalty? She clearly moves away from the Ball looking for contact
LG601aTJ3Rw,"A GAME FOR THE AGES, WOMEN FOOTBALL ON THE RISE"
LG601aTJ3Rw,Did Chelsea pay the ref. That is not a penalty. Please investigate this disgrace.
LG601aTJ3Rw,Too many fatal mistakes from the Blues's captain. Since the first leg. Almost causing the game.
LG601aTJ3Rw,Scandalous penalty. A shame
LG601aTJ3Rw,Nice game COYB
LG601aTJ3Rw,"Lyon‚Äî It's not Christmas yet.
 VAR ‚Äî I don‚Äôt care."
LG601aTJ3Rw,What a disgrace
LG601aTJ3Rw,Man of the match: the ref
LG601aTJ3Rw,What a come back
LG601aTJ3Rw,Dont be surprised its a london thing
LG601aTJ3Rw,"Great game, well done the Chels! üëèüëèüëè"
LG601aTJ3Rw,Champions of Europe soon on both men‚Äôs and women team

rtC1vV1-MoY,"The person with the highest score in this match is Danielle Van de Donk. A completely different game from the first match (DvD just played in second half), Lyon needs to understand the value of the bright Dutch star. Chelsea players didn't even have the desired passes with DvD's smart play and high pressing."
rtC1vV1-MoY,A classy header pass from Van de Donk.
rtC1vV1-MoY,The best moment was when James failed.
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Don't have people at DAZN, who can pronounce the name of the players correctly?"
rtC1vV1-MoY,The commentators are so biased. When Lyon was already winning with 2goals they were suddenly not talking much. When the penalty happened for Chelsea they're suddenly so alive and have so much to say üòÇ
rtC1vV1-MoY,Barca has √©limined the cheaters of Chelsea!! Thanks Bar√ßa !!
rtC1vV1-MoY,NO PENALTY THIS A HOLD UP AGAINST LYON!!
rtC1vV1-MoY,how was that a penalty it was a super light touch but she knew that falling would be their last chance to win
rtC1vV1-MoY,chelsea my team wow women
rtC1vV1-MoY,"It‚Äôs so clear what the ref wanted before that last minute penalty. She wanted to send the players away because the penalty would be the last action. But the error lies in disregarding the possibility of a rebound - this must be taken by any player, which means any player of the other team needs to get the chance for clearance. So the ref was wrong there."
rtC1vV1-MoY,1:37:50 Penalty for Lyon... VAR does not react... how strange ! üòáüòÇ
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Chelsea don't deserve it, apart from Reiten's super goal, they didn't show anything. And without Kerr and James, I'm not even talking about it. Chelsea fans have to pray they don't get hurt."
rtC1vV1-MoY,1:32:56 this was just so nasty
rtC1vV1-MoY,Was excited to watch this but having an ad break literally every five minutes (while game play is on) is a joke. After the third ad in less than twenty minutes a goal had been missed. I give up with DAZN. Clearly don't care about viewer experience whatsoever. Just money grabbers.
rtC1vV1-MoY,"As always English teams got that referee help,typical"
rtC1vV1-MoY,"That was NEVER a penalty, she tripped herself over, that referee is a disgrace. ü§®üëéüëéüëé"
rtC1vV1-MoY,Watched on phone. Stopped watching when they made it 2 -0. Could not believe my phone the next day. Cmon the chels. I wish our men's team had their heart and belief. Emma Hayes could do a job in men's football. No doubt.
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Yes, Chelsea last minute penalty kept their hopes alive. But why could Lyon as the 8 time champions not kick their penalties like champions and win the match."
rtC1vV1-MoY,"I just hope the semis will be exciting like this match. There's no excitement in 90minute matches, when extra time is available."
rtC1vV1-MoY,"There is no contact at all! Look at the view we see at 2.48.15, it‚Äôs a real emulation !"
rtC1vV1-MoY,Well done to Chelsea women hopefully they can emulate the men and youth teams and win the Champions LeagueüèÜ‚öΩ
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Had it been that Chelsea men have football coach like their female counterparts, we could have been a bit hopeful that we can win something."
rtC1vV1-MoY,That was never a penalty. I am yet to see footage showing that the Lyon defender made a leg move and made contact with Recce James's sister's legs.
rtC1vV1-MoY,So glad Chelsea won..and delighted renard the French trouble maker lost üòÇ and also missed the penalty üéâüò¢
rtC1vV1-MoY,"The ref couldn¬¥t handle the pressure from Chelsea about given them that penalty or not. Lyon-player didn¬¥t kick any leg. 
The commentary neutral :)))) ?! Yes, I saw the whole match and Lyon was better overall.
10 sec from semifinal and then this awful decision by the ref."
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Everyone saying that was not a pen. As long as the rule is applied, it's a pen. I have watched both male and female football and have seen softer pens. Including in the world cup."
rtC1vV1-MoY,"melanie leupolz breaks her nose 1:32:30

rtC1vV1-MoY,"Amazing finish, what a cool head to take that penalty in the 120th minute...Hey girl, give Harry Kane some pointers on not bottling it at penalties, thx...."
rtC1vV1-MoY,Wat a big match üëè the sky is blue üíô
rtC1vV1-MoY,Sam really did a no looker for the penalty and scored
rtC1vV1-MoY,"I can't believe the revisionism on here... how people can say they don't understand how it's a pen I have no idea. Soft, maybe, but I've seen A LOT softer than that given. Talk of bias is ridiculous given the ways decisions went in the match."
rtC1vV1-MoY,What a robbery... üòÇ
rtC1vV1-MoY,Barca will butcher Chelsea. The penalty was a joke.
rtC1vV1-MoY,"this was the most spectacular soccer I have EVER watched!! I cried in the end, so happy for Berger!!!"
rtC1vV1-MoY,This match was crazy!!!
rtC1vV1-MoY,@2:38:07 Lyon should deserve a freekick. the ball is out of the box in her hands
rtC1vV1-MoY,Shame on the referee for giving a non existing penalty !
rtC1vV1-MoY,What a farce ! No way it can be a penalty...
rtC1vV1-MoY,Chelsea going to  meet   FC barcelona   semi-final   on 22 april
rtC1vV1-MoY,"NEVER a pen, she tripped herself up! Watch it from 2:49:06 onwards and put the player on to a slower playback speed... (0.5 or slower) and you'll see at 2:49:13 that she trips herself up!
Laughable VAR effort, on a par with the mens game!"
rtC1vV1-MoY,James siblings have the football blood. Props up to their parents for encouraging them both to hone their talent!
rtC1vV1-MoY,Just imagine both the Chelsea men and women team getting both finals and winning them
rtC1vV1-MoY,VAR steal the game
rtC1vV1-MoY,Waooo‚Ä¶. Up blues !
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Shameless dive. Really... What's the point of VAR? It's a contact sport, she tripped her own leg. Oldest trick in the book."
rtC1vV1-MoY,the pen was a joke. clipped own heels
rtC1vV1-MoY,Just to be Clear the Refereeing was absolutely against Chelsea . . . No Red Card for Van de Donk and No yellows for Lyon players in so many offences and the Ref allowed them to play a Corner at the End of 2nd Half Additional Time by 20 Sec ( While she didn't allow Chelsea to counter and complete the min and didn't allow Chelsea to play a very well earned Free Kick at the end of the First ) . . . She Didn't want to Give the PK which was Freaking 200% CLeaaaaaaaaaaar !
rtC1vV1-MoY,"If you want to work your cardio, watch this match!"
rtC1vV1-MoY,We are Chelsea üíô
rtC1vV1-MoY,That's never a pen tho
rtC1vV1-MoY,"that penalty shootout was awful, most the pens were so predictable. also wasn‚Äôt a penalty in extra time, lyon should of won"
rtC1vV1-MoY,"I have to say Chelsea really wanted that win. Even when they were close to being eliminated they never gave up. Wow they are warriors. Well done Lyon too, they did amazing in terms of the performance. However games can change just like that and we have witnessed something insane tonight."
rtC1vV1-MoY,the blue bloods will go further!üíôüò≠üíô

rtC1vV1-MoY,This was the final. Any other match after this is a friendly

rtC1vV1-MoY,Just went there
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Lauren James subbed before halftime against City at the weekend and here wins a penalty at a critical moment smart in ghosting past two players and receiving a clear foul...

tz5XV0_cAM4,This is cheat!
tz5XV0_cAM4,James is the biggest cheat going! Unbelievable corruption here
tz5XV0_cAM4,"Becho is inexperienced, she was fooled by James who sent the ball to the left while remaining glued to her. James wasn't trying to cross or shoot, she slowed her pace just enough by dragging her foot back which was why she was losing the ball."
tz5XV0_cAM4,Same old CHELSEA always Cheating

O31p8mH_ItM,"Hmmm, is it just me or does anyone notice that when *Arsenal* loses a match, the pitchforks come out & primarily get aimed at *Stina Blackstenius?* Yet when they win, those same pitchfork carrying doubters miraculously disappear into thin air. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Funny how that works, huh? üôÑ

P.S. Because I don‚Äôt live in England (thus meaning I would not get the footy news as quickly as you Londoners do) has anyone heard any updates on the health status of *Kim Little & Katie McCabe* after both left the game today with injury‚Äôs?"
O31p8mH_ItM,I don't really know where ds Referees do come from! Both of these refrees on ds 2 legged ties are not just up to the standards at all. Thumbs up for Arsenal ladies to not allow incompetence of the refrees to weigh them down. What a performance for the 2 legs #Coyg
O31p8mH_ItM,"When you see Lina Magull and Sch√ºller subbed its the equivalent in basketball when your starting five are taken off kind of a surrender by Strauss its all on the league for Bayern now...

O31p8mH_ItM,New of the Bayern Women's Champions League What Gunners
O31p8mH_ItM,Leah should stay as captain she inspires her teams to win every time.
O31p8mH_ItM,The Arsenal Women's team gave everything to earn this win in the face of adversity.  This win would take them up a level in terms of belief in the process.
O31p8mH_ItM,"I have support Arsenal for many years, since the 90s, and now I'm starting to follow Woman's football too, but I do not like man coaching ladies, this coach ask his players to fake and disrespect the fair game, this woman's Aresenal team fake sooooo many fouls and loose soooo much time, in this case I think mans team is more honest and fair on their way of playing, I hope this change, because ladies football should be honest, that is the only way I will support Arsenal, play hard but clean and honest!!‚úå‚úå‚úå"

IHhUfdvbuus,Barca really knows how to scout their players
IHhUfdvbuus,am feeling funny...by looking this...üòÖü§£ü§£ü§£and how the fans are watching this by booking the tickets....ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£they dont know that their cash is wastingü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

IHhUfdvbuus,Thanks for not giving away the outcome in the thumbnail! I hate when clips do that.
IHhUfdvbuus,Sorry. Can‚Äôt watch it. The some money. For what ?!
IHhUfdvbuus,Driblling No 10 of Barca was ü•µü•µü•µ
IHhUfdvbuus,womens football really improved over the last years

IHhUfdvbuus,"We need to see a super cup style game between the woman‚Äôs CL winners vs the men‚Äôs under 19‚Äôs cup winner, would be so cool"
IHhUfdvbuus,BARCA >>italy.
IHhUfdvbuus,It Was Great and Nice Game For Both Team Great Ladys I Like It
IHhUfdvbuus,Shola not well fed with passes
IHhUfdvbuus,man..this is boring. slow and weak. its like watching a 8th league game.
IHhUfdvbuus,Barcelona's number 20 looks like a dude.. Is that really a woman or a transgender?
IHhUfdvbuus,"Mad respect for roma, only 1-0 against barcelona, they can be proud of themselves"
IHhUfdvbuus,"How truly awful.  Basically a form of cross dressing.No thought for all the long term injuries and effects this will have on them.
Next up: ""men's"" rhythmic gymnastics? üôÑüôÑ
Clearly the Neoliberal Establishment wants to force this down people's throats. Men have no interest in it. And the overwhelming majority of women and girls have no desire to ""emulate"" men like this. Lets take a step back to common sense and reality.
ü§Æü§Æ"
IHhUfdvbuus,Barcelona so dominant it's not even funny. Roma goalie was impressive though
IHhUfdvbuus,Great shots by Oshoala that were only stopped by a great keeper
IHhUfdvbuus,WELL DONE ROME IN THE SECOND HALF.
IHhUfdvbuus,where is alexia putellasüôÑ
IHhUfdvbuus,The Roma Goalkeeper is Lit
IHhUfdvbuus,Great defent a italyan tim..
IHhUfdvbuus,1  0   away  well don  barca woman's  love  you  all  üòçüòç  specially  graham hanson number 10   wawo wonderful  excellent üí™
IHhUfdvbuus,i think this barca team can score the male team
IHhUfdvbuus,Graham Hansen is world class!
IHhUfdvbuus,The ladies game are improving rapidly...I'm loving the investment
IHhUfdvbuus,"Jesus Christ it was not Barcelona's #20 game today, she could've had a hat-trick easily..."
IHhUfdvbuus,Do not estimate the Italians!
IHhUfdvbuus,Paredes is the weak link in Barca's defense. Terrible defender. Her performance against Lyon in the last year's final was one of the worst i've seen.
IHhUfdvbuus,Wish they could play the men so they can realize that theyll never get payed the same as men
IHhUfdvbuus,"Well done üëç to the Roma goalkeeper, she did very well"
IHhUfdvbuus,4:39 what a saveü´°
IHhUfdvbuus,Worst defending from roma.. Actually roma gk vs barcelona femenino is the match
IHhUfdvbuus,Great fight from Roma
IHhUfdvbuus,Roma defended well and the goalkeeper was brilliant.
IHhUfdvbuus,"Bar√ßa dominated the game both phisically and technically, and yet Roma had 4 clear score opportunities as well: Giacinti x 2, Andressa and Giugliano. I am not counting poor attempts like Havi's and Glionna's, and if I don't, then neither should you on Bar√ßa's side. Bar√ßa's goalkeeper saved her net just as much as Roma's, if you comment without prejudice. Of course Bar√ßa is way stronger and will 99% pass to the semifinals; if they do, I will cheer for them because they are spectacular. But when you compare the two teams you should keep in mind that this one is the first year of professionism in Italy's women football, that this is the very first WCL participation for Roma Women, and that this is the first time they play at home in front of 40k people, whereas in the regular season they play in a 3k people court without any illumination, which forced them to play elsewhere the ""home"" European matches. I could not be more proud of the girls, the stadium was amazing yesterday night, I still have shivers. I never thought I would say this, but Roma Women is reconciliating me with the inherent beauty of the game, whereas the male team (which is the one I root for since I was a child) is all tension, anger and rivalry."
IHhUfdvbuus,is this football or comedy? lol
IHhUfdvbuus,"Brilliant performance from Roma but in Catalunya leg, just forget it. Football is in the same level with Male, more companies are interested"
IHhUfdvbuus,"It's amazing what PR can achieve - you can make people believe there's a pandemic when the hospitals are empty, you can make them take a deadly cure to this non-deadly disease, and you can make them watch women's football!
Edit - that's assuming that all these views are genuine and not paid for, and assuming that those views aren't by mistake..."
IHhUfdvbuus,Parking a bus team
IHhUfdvbuus,"Great game for Salma Paralluelo, and a wonderful Goal!! Barca are so lucky to have her!"
IHhUfdvbuus,Barcelona ran out of gas last 20 minutes which was interesting. Wonder if it was schedule or game?
IHhUfdvbuus,"Oshoala tried, but the Roma keeper and defenders equally tried."
IHhUfdvbuus,Barca's no10 is unbelievable. Her dribbling reminds me of Martha of Brazil
IHhUfdvbuus,Oshoala play well today just that the goal did not come.
IHhUfdvbuus,See you all at the Spotify camp nou üòàüòàüòà
IHhUfdvbuus,So Roma doesnt have a highlight ? This just a highlight of all the things Barcelona did .and it's very shameful
IHhUfdvbuus,In the first half i didn't see any Roma attempt üò≤üò≤üò≤. They just came to defend at home ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
IHhUfdvbuus,who's roma goalkeeper? that's dope ... Visca Barca. lets win this title once more
IHhUfdvbuus,This game was entertaining compared to wnba lol üòÇ
IHhUfdvbuus,We needed more goals in this first leg so they shouldn't have started Asisat Oshoala...Geyse Ferreira was the option
IHhUfdvbuus,Great frikin game and both goalkeepers üò±  üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëç
IHhUfdvbuus,"Roma have seriously stepped up, that was a great performance from them!!"
IHhUfdvbuus,What deception! Bar√ßa could win this game by 3 vs 0
IHhUfdvbuus,Brilliant goalkeeping on both sides. How on earth could this game end with only one goal.
QSbGOx90T1E,what a game! moral score 3x3... 4x4 ... 5x5 ...
QSbGOx90T1E,Graham writes poetry in the field üí´
QSbGOx90T1E,I didn‚Äôt realize how bad woman‚Äôs football actually was
QSbGOx90T1E,Our women from Barcelona played absolutely top level football
QSbGOx90T1E,Free game. because Bar√ßa several opportunities for goals and Roma despite everything could have won in the end so amazing
QSbGOx90T1E,Great game.  Glad to see Roma is so close to join the elite of european football

T2GyJbOWsCw,"Roma's goalie should kick ball out of danger towards midfield instead of rolling ball out, this strategy is a formula for disaster also getting Roma's players exhausted fighting barrage of opponents from scoring so close to goal post."
T2GyJbOWsCw,oshoala has grown yoh! üòçüòçüòç
T2GyJbOWsCw,"the ref was about to blow the whistle for the foul just before the Barca goal and then tried to play advantage, the advantage went away immediately and she didn't blow it dead. 2 Roma players thought she was going to blow it and didn't pressure Walsh because of it. it's just a pathetic standard of ref, even with VAR in  place. like Barca need any more help."
T2GyJbOWsCw,"Oshuala's finishing and predictability in front of the goal is diminishing rapidly. She needs to pick it up in double quick time, before the second leg."
T2GyJbOWsCw,"Of course, Barcelona is far better but they didn't score a 2nd goal, so, at the end could have been a draw. They must do better against Chelsea or Wolfsburg, otherway... Roma played well, like they have to. .. and ask to Minami : Graham Hansen was on fire."
T2GyJbOWsCw,Im a fans Roma too.. i think roma full lucky against team like Barca
T2GyJbOWsCw,"That Lucy Bronze ""handball"" looked deliberate to me. It's the way she did it."
T2GyJbOWsCw,So Bronze got punched in the face but it was her who got up first?üòÇ
T2GyJbOWsCw,"That's how you do it girls!
Let's go Bar√ßa!!"
T2GyJbOWsCw,"I am not a barca fan, but the commentator lucy ward is clearly baised against Barcelona, she is always saying something negative about Barcelona, she needs to do better"
T2GyJbOWsCw,"Don't walk into a dark alley with Roma.
You might win the fight but they'll leave you without a liver."
T2GyJbOWsCw,"Roma         0
Barcelona 1

I believe Barcelona will win 5-0 on aggregate."

Y98q0NvZB5g,Commentator says defender's arm was clearly in the natural position as the defender extends her arm to stop the ball.

I‚Äôll check back in another 25 years, and in the meantime keep watching e-sports instead. DougDoug is the greatest athlete of the 21st century, _even if_ he‚Äôs an icky, disgusting male."

Y98q0NvZB5g,Womens football the joke that keeps on giving.
Y98q0NvZB5g,What a game! Hope Arsenal turns it around in the second leg!
Y98q0NvZB5g,"Bayern  1
Arsenal 0

I believe Arsenal will win 3-1 at home though"
Y98q0NvZB5g,Arsenal plays well but they need a serial scorer. They miss Miedema and Mead.
Y98q0NvZB5g,Tell me the aggregate üî¥‚ö™
Y98q0NvZB5g,At least it's not 5 - 1
Y98q0NvZB5g,"It's clear what team the ref and VAR favoured tonight. Poor decisions and referring truth be told, how did they miss a clear back pass and penalty is beyond me as they were checked and missed by VAR. If that is the standard of refferring and VAR decisions we should expect in these matches, then the game of Women's football is in even more trouble than I thought."

It will be interesting to see how Arsenal progress through this competition, and domestically, after two huge injury blows. I wouldn't totally write them out of the WSL challenge, but they are going to be really stretched to compete for the win in this tournament. Barcelona have been far from perfect in several games this year, but they are still the team you have to beat to win the competition. Game on...."

Take Aitana, Paruello, Mapi Leon, Mariona, Oshoala, Marta Torrej√≥n and Irene Paredes and put them on another team and you instantly have a top two team in the world and Barcelona still keeps its number one status with Alexia, Pina, Graham, Bronze, Fridolina Rolf√∂,  Pa√±os, Ingrid Syrstad Engen, Esmee Brugts and Keira Walsh"

7ZWCnO3dt0k,"Arsenal women to night were tired sluggish slow ro the ball, Leon won the tackles. they did not deserve to score.  Maanam was terrible, constantly running into danger, but Blackstenius was the worst, she is simply not a Arsenal Team player,. The Manager lost this game tonight thpough reason being he could see that the women were back passing so much it felt we were playing totally the wrong way that we beat ourselves. Catley I AM NOT A FAN OF BUT SHE IS MY PLAYER OF THE MATCH  she did her job and more. The commentator  said they need magic huh? but she seen the same thing that the back passing was so so so shocking we had four players most times in groups and Raffaelle kept back passing not looking forward. Miedema and Mead missing injured badly."

Q_wm422mRJQ,"Indoubtedly all very, very worthy football players (with my favourite of the lot mentioned here being W.

5kt7GfuvVo4,Why is Oshoala always on the bench? They lost because they did not have a Poacher
5kt7GfuvVo4,Men or women don't matter. Barca always becomes the victim of Bayern's wrath.

5kt7GfuvVo4,"Fantastic job from Bayern and well deserved win. From a Barca fan, i agree with some comments about or Game Style, we need more variations and open the field.
I have confidence in a Champions League win this season. But they are not perfect and we must recognize the great level of other teams too."
5kt7GfuvVo4,Congrats Bayern
5kt7GfuvVo4,Possibly the best performance Bayern has produced. They were at it all game. Played with real guts and determination to stop Barca from developing any sort of momentum

Yoejbiqstzo,I love the black uniform
Yoejbiqstzo,I felt pity for Miedema. The Arsenal coach never played her in her prefer position after Blacksteinous come to Arsenal. Miedema is more clinical and can score more goals.
Yoejbiqstzo,"Miedema was playing well, the rest a little less. They missed a lot of opportunities to score."
Yoejbiqstzo,Arsenal failed to score a lot :(
Yoejbiqstzo,Too many wasted chances
Yoejbiqstzo,Arsenal are not going to win anything without beth mead. They need to get more world class players that squad is too thin.

Take Aitana, Paruello, Mapi Leon, Mariona, Oshoala, Marta Torrej√≥n and Irene Paredes and put them on another team and you instantly have a top two team in the world and Barcelona still keeps its number one status with Alexia, Pina, Graham, Bronze, Fridolina Rolf√∂,  Pa√±os, Ingrid Syrstad Engen, Esmee Brugts and Keira Walsh"

0d_7PwXWLw4,I still don't think Spain will do well in the world cup without all this experienced barca players in that squad
0d_7PwXWLw4,Barca overpowered them in all areas of the field
0d_7PwXWLw4,"Please never let this commentator do a liga f game again, clearly had done no research and had no clue what they are talking about. So many names pronounced incorrectly and massive pauses in the middle of sentences. Genuinely makes this broadcast with sound virtually unwatchable."
0d_7PwXWLw4,"Why do so many broadcasters keep employing this commentator? She is absolutely USELESS. Not only can't she string together a full sentence without stopping for a few seconds after ever 2 or 3 words, which causes her commentary to lag 5 to 10 seconds behind the game, but the words coming out of her mouth frequently bear no relation to what's actually happening on the field in the first place. üôÑ"
0d_7PwXWLw4,1:21:20 In what universe is that not a yellow (or even red) card? And this: 1:34:50 ?
0d_7PwXWLw4,"I'm sure this commentator is a lovely person and all, but her commentary is woefully amateurish, sorry."

0d_7PwXWLw4,Keira Walsh has avenged his revenge with Real Madrid
0d_7PwXWLw4,For Real Madrid I would bench Esther. She needs to stop flapping her gums and playing football instead. She's a detriment to the team week in and week out.
0d_7PwXWLw4,Poor Misa. She's in the wrong team.
0d_7PwXWLw4,"Dear Senior Vilda;
The first job of a football manager is to get his team of players to play for him and commit to his ideas.
If a team and a half (18) of the world's best players are not persuaded perhaps you should retire to an administrative post and let a real football coach and leader of women take over.
Drafting a 3rd choice team under penalty of death from Florentino and the Federation does not seem like an viable option if winning the World Cup is the objective.
If establishing fascist, Castilian rule is the point, well maybe...."
0d_7PwXWLw4,Anybody know why Misa was angry with Aitana at the end?
0d_7PwXWLw4,What‚Äôs with these Brazilians that think the ball belongs only to them!üò°

iPoWXwzwoKI,Swear down Rieten got that 99 crossing and vision....and with Kerr's 99 finishing....its comes Easy2 üòè
iPoWXwzwoKI,"This ain‚Äôt real football, it‚Äôs one big joke, get over itüòÇ"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Sam Kerr is from another planet what a player the Australian is
iPoWXwzwoKI,Karr is supposed to win ballon‚Äôs
iPoWXwzwoKI,Transfer Reiten to the men's team. What an absolute delight to watch. Player of the match for me.
iPoWXwzwoKI,They spelt the opponent team name with 8
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Abdullina can also play at left back.  She and Reiten have very similar running and crossing styles.  If they team up down the left, they'll be a nightmare for opposition defences."
iPoWXwzwoKI,I was in there 1:22
iPoWXwzwoKI,I was in there 1-22
iPoWXwzwoKI,"As a Dane im so proud of Harder..... as a Liverpool fan  i dread  when  the teams meet the next time , eventhough  we beat chelsea 2-1  in the last one"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten is the Female Goat Left wing back
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten was out of this world so on point!!!!!
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten was out of this world so on point!!!!!
iPoWXwzwoKI,Kerr and Harder sure but this was all about Reiten for me! Wow üëèüèª
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Dreadful commentary,but great performance for the ladies ."
iPoWXwzwoKI,I like how when they score they always celebrate and thankful to the player that assisted the goal . Not like the men who score and are just look at me look at me
iPoWXwzwoKI,Chelsea on form
iPoWXwzwoKI,"ReitenüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåKerr üí™üí™üí™üí™ Harderüëçüëãüëã the best in this match was Reiten
men's team needs someone like Reiten üëå"
iPoWXwzwoKI,So nice to see so many couch Chelsea supporters showing their support for their team unlike last night at Kingsmedows where they could not be seen or heard over the away supporters ü§£ü§£ü§£
iPoWXwzwoKI,Up the blues
iPoWXwzwoKI,Bro the opponent is playing like 9 year old
iPoWXwzwoKI,fewer camera angles on the english production than on other european WCL fixtures
iPoWXwzwoKI,"9 times champion of their league and they got Whoop 8 to no üòπ 

All other team of their league would be like how. Real definition of local champion üòπ"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Excellent from chelsea
iPoWXwzwoKI,"USWNT and Lyon women ripe to be upended next year, should be interesting."
iPoWXwzwoKI,Lowest low block I‚Äôve ever seen
iPoWXwzwoKI,Watching the women is better than watching the men honestly
iPoWXwzwoKI,"as we celebrate Reiten, Kerr, Harder.....let's not forget Ingle and Flemming ran the midfield too"
iPoWXwzwoKI,"That harder pass 2:17 
Sheeeeshhhhh 
üêêthing you know"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Harder deserves ballon d'or shouts
iPoWXwzwoKI,Abdullina Alsu was one of exciting future hope she get more chance nice skill.
iPoWXwzwoKI,Sam Kerr is not from planet earth
iPoWXwzwoKI,"‚ÄúNow a Party Political Broadcast by the Kerr and Harder Party.‚Äù

5:50 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised she didn‚Äôt injure herself with those backflips‚Äù"
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Reiten, Harder and Kerr are absolutely world class."
iPoWXwzwoKI,Abdullina‚Äôs crosses were awesome hope she gets more game time
iPoWXwzwoKI,Lol massive deflation for that assist  but no one mentions it not even them deadarse comintaters
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Reiten's crosses are venomous like Reece's, and her corners are better than anyone‚Äôs of the men's team."
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Well done ladies, what a great win!!! #KTBFFH üëèüèæüí™üèæüíôüî•"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Nice one Chelsea
iPoWXwzwoKI,R they that ok or is the other team that bad? Can‚Äôt tell sorry
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten could have had 10 assists in a single game.
iPoWXwzwoKI,So that‚Äôs how the girl from fifa plays
iPoWXwzwoKI,Second goal Harder watched KDB clips üíô for life.. I love this team
iPoWXwzwoKI,Quality players
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Gawd the standard is dreadful, it looks like a schoolboys game. And to think these teams are the top level of women's club football in Europe.
I've seen international games that are terrific but this was very mediocre."
iPoWXwzwoKI,Chelsea proved they can beat small team well.
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Never stop playing Harder, Kerr and Reiten togetherüíôüíôü´°"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten is a baller and Chelsea are ruthless nice to see Kirby back
iPoWXwzwoKI,Deadly front 3üíôüíôüíô
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Reiten is Magic!
What a football Brain!"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Harder tho!
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Kerr coming third in the Ballon d‚ÄôOr once again this year proves that you have to play in the European league in order to win, especially so if you play for Spain. It‚Äôs rigged against anyone playing for an English team despite Kerr deserving to win the trophy!"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Rieten easily the man of the match or should I say woman of the match
iPoWXwzwoKI,"WOW! What a night for Reiten. What, 6-7 assists? Reiten destroyed them!"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten is every forwards delight and great to have Kerr and Harder on point.I bet Emma was buzzing watching this
iPoWXwzwoKI,Omo na volleyball Dem play for here
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten could let all the blind score
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Chelsea (W) be having too much funüòä
C'mon you Bluesüíôüíô"
iPoWXwzwoKI,How does this awful stop-start commentator keep getting games?
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten has more reliable delivery than FedEx
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Well done to the women's team! So lucky to get to watch Kerr and others play for Chelsea. 

Up the Chels!"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Pernille Mosegaard Harder is the best and beautiful football in the world üî•
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten has been involved in a lot of goals lately #KTBFFH
iPoWXwzwoKI,This team is going to win champions league
iPoWXwzwoKI,Kerr should have had another assisted by Reiten at 3:53 cuz that was not offside
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Chelsea are miles ahead of this Team ok 
That score line shows the difference between tow Clubs ‚òπÔ∏è


Congratulations to Chelsea Football Club and hope you win this competition this year ü§î"
iPoWXwzwoKI,These English teams like to play with more possession of the ball dawg.
iPoWXwzwoKI,Hat tricks galore ü§£
iPoWXwzwoKI,"these young ladies from Albania have won their league nine times, yet come to London and get battered by the BEST women's team in the country 8 - 0, so that begs the question, How BAD is that league that they play in???ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î"

SXxtjZlMPig,"Horan the fast Renard teams eat it just like Le Somer Terrible, Lyon literally had no speed on the wings, they were playing with full-backs as wingers, which did not work"

Jm1YZS0gATs,We are the Gunners ‚ù§Ô∏è
Jm1YZS0gATs,Probably just a bad day at the office for Lyon cos at their best they thrash anyone
Jm1YZS0gATs,"England have the best female and male leagues, won the U19 Euros, women's Euros and the Ballon dor awards gave all the awards to La Liga players because FIFA have an agenda against the English."

Jm1YZS0gATs,"Would've been better to play this game in a smaller stadium for a better atmosphere instead of pretending that the demand for women's football is more than it actually is. Anyway, well played Arsenal!! üî•"
Jm1YZS0gATs,What a disatrous defeat for Lyon. They were gunnered by an Arsenal team on fire. I am still impressed
Jm1YZS0gATs,"I‚Äôm not an Arsenal fan by the way. Wanted to watch this but was at the same time as my teams game in the Premier League. Wow, to go to the home of 8 time European Champions and batter them 5-1. Arsenal are unstoppable so far this season and definitely one of the favourites to win their 2nd UWCL."

3PrZ_HBvEfQ,best team in the world
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Bro what
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,They‚Äôre playing against bots
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Benfica was very close to have a draw.
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Less competition in any game is boring üòë
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,What's the point of a team like Benfica being in this competition if their players played like they were not interested in being on the field from the very start.   The Benfica players attitude was disgraceful.
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,https://youtube.com/shorts/X-fObbgGaR4?feature=share shorts hereüòÅ
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,can somebody tell me why this team is not in fifa 23 ea has to do something about this
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,why are they not adding this team in fifa 23 it's really disappointing
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Could have easily been 15-0 plus
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"And because lawlessness is increased, most people‚Äôs love will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end, he shall be saved.‚ÄîMatthew 24:12-13"
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"The benifaca's number 14 is just a joke to Women's football.
Most of the goals were conceded by her fault and lazinessüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ"
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,This no 9 is somewhat selfish.  Unlike Azeezat that was playing with the team.  She is concerned with scoring
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Mariona best player ever by far
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,It looks easy cos it is barca femini doing it...
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,An Arsenal v Barcelona final would be highly entertaining indeed. I only found out this summer that Liverpool had Asisat Oshoala for a season a few years ago. Can‚Äôt believe we let her go.
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Lyon Women is the best Team in the Europe.. Barca Women is the beauty football in the europe.. USNWT ( USA) IS THE BEST TEAM IN THE WORLD..
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,They are like angels üíô‚ù§
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Benfica player on 8th goal ü§£ü§£
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"Great victory, and yet the real test will come with OL, PSG, Arsenal... I hope Bar√ßa has learnt something from last season's defeat"
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Asisat O is not really wanted or rather liked by colleagues.
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"Despite the missed chances, 9?"
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Profesionals. Great team !!!
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"Not being a racist catcher, but i feel Asisat osaola is envied by her white colleagues...Most of the passes where aimed away from her"
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,This team have a chance to win the championship this year.
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"And thats without Alexia, CGH, Walsh.."
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,I just wish the men could emulates these women
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Xavi needs to see how Barcelona REALLY played.
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"Look  at Bonmati, she control that midfield those amazing foot works and pass, hats off wow she's a key player."
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Bar√ßa. The best in the world üèÜ‚öΩ
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Woman team plays better than man
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Oshoala 2 assist two goals super player
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Mannnn!!!can't believe I missed this one!!  The Lyon-Arsenal was the surprise of the evening for me
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"Bonmati has regained her match sharpness. Every player for every other team is now depressed. Great team performance, though a few were under par on the day. I wish Engen could play every game, but when you have captain fantastic Patri it's hard to get Engen on the field but she's superb at putting out fires."
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,And this is without their star winger Caroline and 2 time ballon dor winner Alexia Putellas. Mapi Leon's understanding of the game is on another level. Never seen a CB who controls the game like she does. Genius
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"Dissatisfied,  many wastad chances"
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Mariana caldente very smart playerüòç
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"Really strong team, they will be hard to beat!
I especially love Mapi Leon. Not the one we see the most but she got a brilliant vision of the game and can turn the whole pitch with one pass. In most of the goals tonight she was involved at the start, such a great playmaker!"
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Bar√ßa is the Best Team.
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Without Alexia and Graham
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Can't wait for the Queen Alexia to come back from injury
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Why 9-0? Because nobody cares
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,When barca men will be at the same level.
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Asisat does it so effortlessly.
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Oshoala carried this team last season. And she's about to do it again
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Great performance by Bar√ßa... but Benfica That's just lazy defending... They looked like they were being forced to play
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"I'm really proud of my team.
Everything about the 6th goal was a vintage Barcaesque goal. Gave me chills to be honest. A lot of missed chances in the 1st half but made up for it in the 2nd. What an amazing start to the UWCL campaign. I hope Laia is ok, I missed Caro today and as always, FORCA BARCAüíô‚ù§Ô∏è"
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,And this is without the two time reigning Balon D‚ÄôOr winner
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,That's my barca
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Engen & Rolf√∂....former shewolves üíöüê∫üíö
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"This is why, i only like FC Barcelona Women"
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Benfica is suffering
9SK-lTDFa3U,Mariona very smart playerüòç
xXzISKMqD1c,Meanwhile barcelona just hammered Benfica 9-0
xXzISKMqD1c,Something tells me that this Bayern women's team is somewhat weaker than expected. Chance for Barcelona to take revenge is here.
xXzISKMqD1c,Silly directors who focus the camera ON THE BALL rather than enlarging the view for us to see the whole action !
xXzISKMqD1c,first payment date 21 goals
xXzISKMqD1c,It was more difficult than expected to win for Bayern.
LA8pAg3sFic,Only Cheisa and Pogba can change Juve's Fortune üòê

VJrys-WKTGE,"Goodness me Patri's surname is not Gutierrez, it's Guijarro. It's not a name hard for native English speakers to say (I would know because I am one) - I don't think it's a tall order to expect a commentator to know the names of the players."
VJrys-WKTGE,"DAZN‚Ä¶ this commentary is nothing but giving a different name every ten seconds even if they‚Äôre not on the ball and even if he can‚Äôt be bothered to learn the names - cite: the painfully frequent ‚ÄúGutierrez‚Äù for Patri Guijarro - mixed with the occasional stating when a free kick is being taken or that Bilbao should be happy they‚Äôre not getting totally thrashed. I‚Äôm not sure it could even be called ‚Äúaudio description‚Äù it‚Äôs so empty, let alone ‚Äúcommentary‚Äù since there‚Äôs no commentating in the slightest. Not sure the guy knows the teams or the game, and there‚Äôs zero evidence either way.

DAZN produces some high quality content so it‚Äôs painful to see it being let down by not being able to hire someone with both expertise and commentating ability (maybe it‚Äôs empty due to lack of knowledge, or maybe he knows stuff but doesn‚Äôt have the radio mind to actually say any of it - or maybe, neither) to do the commentary. Hope there‚Äôs someone better for the Champions League since DAZN has the rights for that, too. But hey, if you‚Äôre still looking, I‚Äôm free."

HPMUDWl-gTw,"Womens football (Soccer) has been treated like a joke by the Patriarchal society, We have had to fight to get any acceptance, respect and so many other advantages that have been automatically given to the Males of the game. I'm an ex Matilda and had to play on cricket pitches, paddocks, we even had to wear the men's old jerseys and buy our own shorts, sock, boots and pay full fare to wherever we were scheduled to play and you know what, I was even proud to do that because I was playing for my Country. But now I stand up strong, proud with tears of joy in my eyes, when I see a little 6yr old girl pulling on a new jersey, playing on proper pitches and she turns to me, smiles and says One day I'm going to be like you Coach, my hero.

They started this media campaign that there was unequal pay and almost everyone felt for it.. hey in the end us soccer even paid them millions.. not because uswnt were right about the demands but because of public pressure.. even president Biden was involved.

OGwC9QRKZcM,This has been brilliant to watch. Thankyou.
OGwC9QRKZcM,"It's just a little more time before we win the champions league. Barca feminine lost their first champions league final, won it the next season and lost it again the next season. We lost our first champions league final and it's only a matter of time before we finally lay out hands on it. We have conquered everywhere but Europe, we don't want to be local champions, the next vision is to be the European champions. We are on course to do it. Come on you Blues. üíôüíô"

Thanks to all for the work and the club for the courage to share what‚Äôs behind the veil.  It‚Äôs so inspiring.  And Emma‚Äôs words at the end should be on a poster or painted ion the walls.  Please do a season 2!  KTBFFH!! Up CHELS!"

OGwC9QRKZcM,"Emma Hayes You are something else,
Great work Lady."
OGwC9QRKZcM,"Thanks for a great documentary that really showed us a glimpse from behind the scenes. Really interesting to follow the players and staff, the ups and downs and everything in between. 

It made me appreciate even more the work everyone puts down and how things affect them. It's not often people think about the people at the club and how, at the end of the day, they are just normal people. We see them on the pitch and on social media, but it's not really getting to know them and the stuff they go through. 
This made it more personal. 

This series really showed how hard it is as a player to not getting enough playing time and having to make the decision to stay or leave. 
I felt Deanna Coopers struggles and felt really sorry for her. I also saw Jess Carter finally getting her chance and throughout these six parts go from perhaps not doing quite enough and not really hitting the right level, to grow into a strong player who is just getting better and better. And now she's in the England squad heading to the Women's Euro 2022. 

I hope to see a second season of this series."
OGwC9QRKZcM,Hopefully season 2 captures the champions league win. That's what we're aiming for. I trust 'em. Great work üëèüèΩ
OGwC9QRKZcM,"Emma was like Arsenal women are the dominant team in England üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø, so she wants to take that from them .

OGwC9QRKZcM,"Emma is just different gravy, everything she says is just class"
OGwC9QRKZcM,"Well, this last episode was a dogs breakfast.  Very disappointing and discombobulated.  The first 5 episodes spanned 1/2 a season; the last episode 1.5 seasons.  Crazy.  I get that Covid threw a spanner in the works but the editing for this last episode was just terrible.  The producers should've stuck with the original plan for 8 episodes (at least) and collected more interviews remotely or after being able to return post-lockdown.  They really do need to do a season 2 now, to make up for this mess."
OGwC9QRKZcM,Need season 2
OGwC9QRKZcM,I love watching Chelsea ladies more than Uswnt! Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm even saying that but I‚Äôve been following for 5 years now

k9K64NdTr9E,"What about Rolf√∂, Crnogorcevic and Martens, all three playing for Barcelona last season?"
k9K64NdTr9E,"Portugal only came here thanked to Russia being banned for invading Ukraine. Literally, Portugal also has no equivalent of Cristiano Ronaldo in women's squad. Chance? Zero.

Switzerland's performance has deteriorated rapidly after 2021. I doubt if they can progress either.

Netherlands and Sweden are easy choice to progress though. The Dutch have a squad strong to depth, although under Mark Parsons, he is doing more damages than achievements - probably the English really hate the Dutch. Sweden has won once, and I hope they will conquer it again."
k9K64NdTr9E,we gonna watch live on dazn?

jvLX_CnQgUA,Great players!
jvLX_CnQgUA,IT WILL BE GERMANY OR SPAIN
jvLX_CnQgUA,My Team ‚ù§Ô∏è
HQ9jyfjRzys,"Berger is a weird pick - I'm pretty sure Frohms will be at the goal for all of their games bar some injury or sudden drop of form? Why not, idk, Magdalena Eriksson and Aniek Nouwen?"
HQ9jyfjRzys,"Spain is an one-woman team, same to their men's counterparts, or maybe worse - their only superstar is Alexia Putellas and nothing else. Jorge Vilda lacks the charisma of Luis Enrique to run the game and lessons from Euro 2017 and World Cup 2019 show that, when Spain is overrated, Spain tends to explode itself. Germany and England taught them hard back then and this will be the same. Spain will fail before the trophy.

Germany, being a superpower in women's stage, is definitely the best team in this group and has the highest chance to progress, but Germany is no longer the lone superpower of European women's football anymore and it will be harder for them to win again.

Denmark will be a mystery and Denmark can also inflict surprises against both Spain and Germany, and, I expect the Danish women's side will not make the same mistake against Finland like their men's team (which lost 0-1). Sorry Finns."
HQ9jyfjRzys,"WELL SHE IS HARDER,,LOL"

Wf5c8chs27U,The women‚Äôs building compared to the men‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous!
Wf5c8chs27U,"Great team. My number 1
I will always support this team. Up the Chels"
Wf5c8chs27U,"I don't understand how people that love football can be a team player, I like player like ramona never be on to be in the bench."
Wf5c8chs27U,I have really enjoyed these siries
Wf5c8chs27U,The way Arsenal have started this season we will need a similar performace against them home and away .
Wf5c8chs27U,"Proud of my Swedish girls Magda & Jonna! ‚ù§You are truly team players and show the same you behind the scenes as we get to see in public. I also feel very sad for Sam!

Ramona Bachmann had her peak at a very young age. She started playing in the Swedish league at the age of 17. At that time, women's football was mostly professional in Sweden & Germany. Bachmann and Marta were the big stars in the Swedish league. Ramona was a goal machine. And then other European countries and clubs started to invest in women's football. When she started playing in European clubs, she hasn't performed well at all. 

Many players tend to become great players and more complete the older you get. But in her case, it has been the opposite. When she was young, she was the big star. And the older she's gotten, the worse she's gotten. I don't like her behaviour, but I can still understand her. I think it's been difficult for her to go from being the big star to being benchwarmer. Accepting it! While Ramona was at her best in the Swedish league, Magda was a bench warmer. Now she's captaining her team. üëÄJust a thought!"
Wf5c8chs27U,"Am not even a Chelsea fan so far have watched this series but haven't heard any encouraging, kind words from Emma as a coach. You either play well or be kicked out of the starting Xi and she is always using cursing words."
Wf5c8chs27U,"Cooper got messed around, played 7 league games in her last 3 seasons."
Wf5c8chs27U,"After watching this series in comparison to the Lionesses preparation for the Euro, I have a whole level of appreciation for Sarina Wiegman‚Äôs style of management. The England team were spot on serious, but clearly enjoyed their practice. Sarinna Wiegman would point out what could be better, instead of beating down players for their mistake. I wish Chelsea women luck in the CL."
Wf5c8chs27U,I love Magda so much. She's such a strong personality and an excellent player
Wf5c8chs27U,I really feel for Cooper. She was so well behaved
Wf5c8chs27U,How many episodes?

Wf5c8chs27U,I really love this documentary!
Wf5c8chs27U,Thank you so much for making this series and especially as a Chelsea fan myself. I have developed a bigger connection to the club now. I will support our women‚Äôs team with the same passion as our men‚Äôs üí™
Wf5c8chs27U,I definitely think they should make more these types of series for both the men and women games.
Wf5c8chs27U,ive never really heard EH say anything related to futball. all the coaching is variations of ‚Äúplay better‚Äù
Wf5c8chs27U,This is absolutely fascinating. I‚Äôm low key hooked on this series lol
Wf5c8chs27U,Ramona was an opp
Wf5c8chs27U,I didn't like the way they treated deanne Cooper
Wf5c8chs27U,"Think this should replace Coronation Street, Amazing stuff! Soo excited for the Euros! Go England üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø and Norway üáßüáª!!"
Wf5c8chs27U,I'm stuck on the Deanne cooper game time situation....it's so unfortunate...I just hope Emma has a plan on squad rotation rather than making players to sit on the bench for that long cause I believe everyone at Chelsea women is competitive
Wf5c8chs27U,"This documentary so far has opened my eyes to know more about women football, being a professional footballer and being a Chelsea woman football club player. Clearly there are more to being a footballer than what goes on on the pitch. The real deal are what goes behind the scenes. I love these series. üëçüíô"
Wf5c8chs27U,cool
Wf5c8chs27U,I'm not even a Chelsea fan but I really love this series. Other teams need to do this as well
Wf5c8chs27U,One thing I live for is Chelsea üíôüíôüíôüíôüíô
Wf5c8chs27U,This documentary is very interesting.  I can't wait for the male's especially with Lukaku's situation because football is not just about playing and fans watching
Wf5c8chs27U,I‚Äôm sorry but deanne cooper cries a lot I think she cried 3 or 4 times in this series
Wf5c8chs27U,"I‚Äôm a Man City fan but am really enjoying this!
Shame Chelsea were shamefully HANDED the title this Season (try telling Pep ‚Äúyou‚Äôre in the lead but hey, we‚Äôre going to give the Title to Chelsea, ok?‚Äù  Would NEVER have happened üò°) so might have to miss the end of Season episode as it would only cause me to rant!"
Wf5c8chs27U,"Magdalena Eriksson, what a classy player and captain."
Wf5c8chs27U,Bring next episode thank you
Wf5c8chs27U,"I see a lot of myself in Bachmann. I've been my own worst enemy several times. I've needed to smile and be supportive of others when I wasn't feeling secure myself, too. I guess it's easier to see when it's someone else : )"
Wf5c8chs27U,Episode 5 - not close-captioned. Will it be fixed?
Wf5c8chs27U,"I find it interesting which players they decided to highlight/focus on. Very little Kirby, Magda, Millie, Ji‚Ä¶. Some of the most important players to the squad."
Wf5c8chs27U,"The only thing that i've put ""notification on"" on youtube is this series. Excellent stuff. And im not even a Chelsea fan."
Wf5c8chs27U,its funny how this team won week in week out yet there was so much tension in the squad
Wf5c8chs27U,Its just a matter of when for chelsea to win the champions league. Emma is managing the team alright
Wf5c8chs27U,"Sam Kerr 5:38 : ""In the men's game you have to play well to belong.  In the women's game you have to belong to play well"" ... Seems like nonsense to me.  Would've thought belonging & playing well go together just the same for both men's and women's games.  But interested in peoples thoughts on this..."
Wf5c8chs27U,I really enjoyed watching this documentary
Wf5c8chs27U,"Ramona was her own worst enemy.  Her lack of team-first attitude and focus on herself first was clearly a factor affecting her role and priority in the team.   The immaturity is a bit of a surprise.

EDIT:  After reflecting on this further I think maybe Emma should've done a better job with Ramona too?  This series glosses over what went on but it's hard not to get the impression Emma should've done more to refocus and remotivate Ramona."
Wf5c8chs27U,Every episode convinces me even more Emma is not the manager to take Chelsea to the next level.
Wf5c8chs27U,"Interesting episode but it's clear now this series should have twelve parts, not six... It will be absurd to have it end just when things start to get interesting with progress in uwcl, etc."
AwrfDeGbiHU,A player like her deserves a much nicer statue than that!
AwrfDeGbiHU,"YES, this woman is the milk. We need more statues of women like this who're absolutely 100% beast.
I swear this woman ain't even human and I was one of the first to see it. I knew Vivianne Miedema was Vivianne Miedema before even Vivianne Miedema knew she was Vivianne Miedema. Rose Lavelle is next. You heard it hear first."
AwrfDeGbiHU,"absolute legend, well deserved!"
AwrfDeGbiHU,The GOAT!
AwrfDeGbiHU,That‚Äôs amazing it‚Äôs rare to see any player get a statue while they‚Äôre still playing
AwrfDeGbiHU,And yet... Sam Kerr is a beast !! üòÇ Sam Kerr is the Goat of women football üêê
AwrfDeGbiHU,"Hope Miedema is healing at home and feeling better.
Looking forward to seeing her in NZ/Aust at the WC 2023.
Go well Viv üß°"
AwrfDeGbiHU,Fabulous player and a remarkable human being. Looking forward to seeing Viv represent NL at the World Cup next year. Adore her English spoken so clearly with a Dutch-Glaswegian accent üíú
AwrfDeGbiHU,Keep simple Miedema you are the best!
AwrfDeGbiHU,"Vivianne is an absolute class act both on and off the pitch. Her work with common goal, the less fortunate children, gender equality is commendable. While on the field, her goal scoring exploits are second to none."
AwrfDeGbiHU,"A great striker,much love n respect from Nairobi Kenya.
A die-hard Arsenal supporter"
AwrfDeGbiHU,"A woman 
Playing football what is this madness"
AwrfDeGbiHU,Viv keep going! You and all the females football players deserve only the best!!!
AwrfDeGbiHU,*Also do this year in Barca Femini! They are an unstoppable force üîµüî¥*
AwrfDeGbiHU,"Let's be realistic here, and a sense of proportion. Never heard of this player, and her team is not among the best even in England."
AwrfDeGbiHU,"What an excellent choice. I see her on and off the field as someone I would hope young girls and boys would emulate. She is respectful, dedicated and humble. I am thrilled"
AwrfDeGbiHU,the üêê

AwrfDeGbiHU,Amazing and well deserved. üòç
AwrfDeGbiHU,Where do you go from here?? 25 years old and already has a statue!
AwrfDeGbiHU,Great stuff. This  is quite similar to Zlatan getting a statue when PSG brought him. Hope Miedema stays at Arsenal and keep winning trophies.
AwrfDeGbiHU,Hopefully the statue gets moved to the Arsenal ground
RycT_eBYAz0,Another day another great goalkeeper
