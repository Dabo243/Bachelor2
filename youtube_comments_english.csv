DjGz9s60R9I,Only 300 people turned up to see this ????
DjGz9s60R9I,"even in women's football, the referee is against Madrid, it's so sad :("
DjGz9s60R9I,"When it’s not Linda it’s Alba, or Eva, Lakrar, Athanea, Weir - they’re beginning to play like a solid team from top to bottom in the last leg of the Liga F season,  ;-)"
DjGz9s60R9I,Who has paid the referee?
DjGz9s60R9I,"Athenea's GOLAZO should NOT have been cancelled. There is absolutely no foul whatsoever before she scores, the ref literally invented a foul... Alba doesn't control the ball with her hand, nor does Yasmim foul the Badalona player. Even the English commentator was left without words at such an idiotic decision. Let me add, there was also a penalty on Eva which wasn't given and a yellow shown to Athenea where she didn't even touch the Badalona player... it must be said that all game they were flopping like they were being shot from a cannon."
Wx6ihpqjzpg,"Barca Men’s team - 🗿
Barca women’s team - 💀"
Wx6ihpqjzpg,"It's been awhile since I watched barca highlights.  I forgot how great they are. As far as I can tell, there is no one better in Women's football at Club level.  That does not mean they will win every game, but overall, there is none better."
Wx6ihpqjzpg,"This Barcelona team, is amazing"
Wx6ihpqjzpg,Our ladies can score Man United
Wx6ihpqjzpg,this team can easily beat current Man Utd male squad.
Wx6ihpqjzpg,is this same real Madrid or dif Madrid?
Wx6ihpqjzpg,Great match💙❤️💙❤️
Wx6ihpqjzpg,"What a goal from Lopez...Barca femini dominated and she just run a lone on the top..Alexia, Bonmati, Pina ,Eva, Lopez, Graham ❤❤❤❤Bravo Barca"
Wx6ihpqjzpg,what a free kick from mapi! ❤
Wx6ihpqjzpg,This girls will always deliver ❤
Wx6ihpqjzpg,"Mapi Leon was the Woman of the Match. Her directing the offense was amazing. Her goal and her brilliant passing. She passed one to Rolfo that was superb. Rolfo had a great goal, but she couldn't dribble past anyone and she was more likely to lose the ball than doing anything with it. She's been terrible all season. Last season when Rolfo was injured, Ona took control of that side and was spectacular. This season with Rolfo being reinstated and Ona on the other side has been awful. That's the coach's fault. Jana had the best game I've seen her play. Surprisingly strong and confident. Bonmati and Kiko were two others that had a great match:)"
Wx6ihpqjzpg,Schertenleib moving her hair out of the way before scoring 🥶
Wx6ihpqjzpg,"Hello, does anyone know what channel is broadcasting women's soccer on TV?"
Wx6ihpqjzpg,I told them don’t wear white jersey against Barcelona but they dent listen.🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Wx6ihpqjzpg,a little keeper in a big goal :)
iA70sfOTXQ8,Lehman out the squad?
cFcN1Y12fyE,"a rigged game, everything has been fixed, planned"
Al-VY9kFTfI,Why isn't Alisha Lehmann not playing?
Al-VY9kFTfI,Juventus with another huge win over Fiorentina as both teams still have to face each other in the Playoff Tournament and the second leg in the Semi Final of the Italian Womens Cup.. Barbara Bonansea on the scoresheet yet again and Martina Rosucci coming on and rather help Juve attack.. she helped out defensive duties playing very well covering left back and right centre back.. Rosucci should of started 😂
5Znib3vuh64,"See, looks so much better in the main stadium where it should be, like Liga MX Feminille do."
5Znib3vuh64,"Atleti dropping points again?
I really thought they could challenge for the champions league spots"
5_F_rWSzC5A,I was so baffled when mary wasn't allowed to wear tape 🤔 never seen that before lol
5_F_rWSzC5A,Another huge win for PSG in their race for 2nd place against local rivals Paris FC.. Lyon and both Paris Clubs have already qualified for next season Uefa champions league since the other teams behind them can no longer catch them.. Let's hope soon to be League Champions Lyon helps PSG by beating Paris FC on the 12th April..
zB4-e5PJRco,Danz full from what 😢😢
FC3OAaPgCA0,DAZN NOTE >>> TRUMP IS VERY CUNNING HE IS PROVOKING/ FEARING ARABS TO RE-BUILD GHAZA WHICH IS TOTALY JOB OF USA/ ISRAEL WHO DESTROYED GHAZA ???? HA HA HA HA
6etVVAHpxm8,she is hot
6etVVAHpxm8,"Female Japanese players are amazing, not only talented, so tactically disciplined they are a joy to watch."
6etVVAHpxm8,Looks like musiala now has a female counterpart.
6etVVAHpxm8,The amazing thing is that she prefers kicking with her right foot and yet she uses her left foot as if that is her main kicking foot. That's amazing skill right there. She definitely has the potential to be one of the best football players in the world.
6etVVAHpxm8,Where did this Momoko Tanikawa come from? JFC
6etVVAHpxm8,DAZE full from what 🤔🤔🤔
6etVVAHpxm8,Potential to be one of the best female footballer in the world. What a gem from Japan.

y3TYREywP7E,Why can't we watch the full match on youtube?
y3TYREywP7E,A nice game from Wolfsburg
76_v9SqfhDw,"1:11:39 ""nice flash to the face"" & 1:12:50 ""the imprint of the ball on her face""  😮😖 - British humor from the happy moderator 👎"
76_v9SqfhDw,Mighty winner SGE !!
76_v9SqfhDw,"This could be the game that maybe cost Bayer Leverkusen the title race and finish outside of The Uefa champions league place if results go against them.. Bayer Leverkusen must win every single remaining League game against SGS Essen, Hoffenheim, Carl Zeiss Jena, Werder Bremen, Bayern Munich, FC Koln, Potsdam, RB Leipzig and VFL Wolfsburg.."
N_gOkb8xqcI,Wish she had been able to play yesterday's fa cup match
N_gOkb8xqcI,Best try❤🔥💪.
W3oPf4FWr8Q,Como goals 7:45 and 8:22
W3oPf4FWr8Q,Will Como go finally to champions league?
W3oPf4FWr8Q,But what about red card?..
NK7eLbhu9EQ,Popp the absolute best ❤❤
dF9uUhS5w20,What a player! Danish goat
dF9uUhS5w20,"Really enjoyed Harder when she was playing on Chelsea. Mostly header goals here, but I thought her playmaking was some of the best in women's soccer. Glad she is doing well."
dF9uUhS5w20,Hello Heppy new Year
dF9uUhS5w20,"nice goals, but what really makes her stand out is her game intelligence and her huge influence on the team. the goals are just a very nice bonus imo."
dF9uUhS5w20,Hello garals Heppy new Year
NG35REVSBe0,"While everyone is talking about Barcelona, Lyon, Arsenal, Chelsea or City, Bayern Munich can become this season's dark horse. 
Flawless during their first five games, they had a bit of bad luck during round 6 against Arsenal.
If they can get more shots on target and be more accurate in the conversion of their chances, Bayern will be a serious danger for the aforementioned big five."
4568qaQCpEY,"Sorry, but Bayern should have won"
4568qaQCpEY,Min 20'20 bùhl what a look 🤨
4568qaQCpEY,Why does it not let me watch the match live on here but then after the match it lets me
4568qaQCpEY,Corner arsenal!
4568qaQCpEY,"i would say it was a 2-2 game, lucky to get a penalty so late."
4568qaQCpEY,Now we want to play Chelsea ladies next
4568qaQCpEY,"Far too much training, back and forth, pushing and above all playing back without need from FC Bayern. The midfield players had more of a pull to the back than to the front. Managing - that acts as a weakness for your own team and as an incentive for the opponent. That's boring for the viewer - as a viewer you switch off beforehand. The next day you have the proof in the result that this behavior was punished again."
4568qaQCpEY,Rene has done an unbelievable job. Complete 180 from Jonas. Deserves the job full time.
4568qaQCpEY,"Pity the game was at Meadow Park. Should have been at the Emirates. Nevertheless, I expected Arsenal to win this one. This is a completely different and better Arsenal than the one that lost 5-2 in Germany.

Bayern did not lose this group in London. They lost it after the draw in Norway. Those were highly expensive points thrown away. If Bayern had won in Norway, this 3-2 loss would still bring them the group victory due to head-to-head result. Now Bayern will face a group winner = Barcelona, Lyon or Chelsea. Just like the She-Wolves, who will face Barcelona, Arsenal or Chelsea.

Having said this, Bayern and the She-Wolves have to batter themselves up, otherwise quarter final will be their terminus and Barcelona, Lyon and two of the English teams will proceed to the semis.
On a positive note: quarters are March 2025, so there are still three months of time to improve."
4568qaQCpEY,Great game
4568qaQCpEY,YOU FOUGHT FOR IT ❤❤❤
4568qaQCpEY,"Rene you've got my love, respect and support"
4568qaQCpEY,What did I just watch? Turgid football and goalkeepers that I just cannot believe get paid actual real money
4568qaQCpEY,What a turn around this interim coach has done
4568qaQCpEY,Bayern should've played Tanikawa
4568qaQCpEY,"Pure Englische Fankultur bei 2:58, ein eigener Chant für van Domselaar. Gotta love traditional English fan culture, if only the tickets were still affordable for the dedicated, creative lot..."
4568qaQCpEY,"Russo, awful defender, on fire in attack. Well done Arsenal, Kyra C-C is a weapon."
YDY9jOhaDMc,"That was the worst game from Vålerenga this season, what happened there? Attack was totally not functioning. Vålerenga Jenter what happened. We know You can way better then this. Hope lessons taken. Vi går, Vi går, Vi kjører. Dere er fantastiske, super sesong. VÅLERENGA, VI ER STOLTE AV DERE 🎉🎉🎉"
YDY9jOhaDMc,"why does Lehmann look like she had a car crash at a chemical plant? Yuck 
also fire the commentator. or teach him the right pronunciation."
YDY9jOhaDMc,Alisha Lehmann is a sprinter and great addition for the team.
YDY9jOhaDMc,"It's BONANSEA, not BONANSI!"
YDY9jOhaDMc,Highlights are 8 minutes longer than needed 😂
YDY9jOhaDMc,No fans 😢
YDY9jOhaDMc,That pronunciation of Bonansea 🤦
YDY9jOhaDMc,"The reason as to why Lehmann did not put that ball across the front of the goal and instead took a low percentage shot is the same as it was when she was playing at Aston Villa, it's all about her, not the team."
rHsD2Mz7I3o,"What a match,  👍 I guess they'll meet each other again in the final. 😃"
rHsD2Mz7I3o,Manchester City as a club appear to be deliberately losing.
rHsD2Mz7I3o,"It was an easy task for Barcelona. This is because Manchester City only has a goalkeeper behind the midfielder.

It's as if Manchester City doesn't have any defenders. Barcelona must score more.

Manchester City's defenders disappear when defending, but appear when attacking and destroy all chances without moving the ball forward."
rHsD2Mz7I3o,Bro Alexia is just Her👑😮‍💨
uuMumWWhff8,Freigang can't stop scoring. Neither can Chiba.
uuMumWWhff8,Laura Freigang is the footballer in the world right now!
FVPXZYz2D2Y,Juventus (specificly) need a female coach?
FVPXZYz2D2Y,Clara Buhil is the player of the match
FVPXZYz2D2Y,"To the commentator: If you want to see scrappy goals, start with Geoff Hurst's non-goal 3:2 1966. I'm an eyewitness."
FVPXZYz2D2Y,"The satisfaction level 📈 after Bayern beat Juve with the same referee not giving valid Pen to Germany. Let's just admit, Juve did nothing in the offence, with all respect to Bayern's players &  goals.."
FVPXZYz2D2Y,1:41:15 Lea has some rearview mirror.
FVPXZYz2D2Y,Great goal by Sehitler.

QVq3ttlp0bI,Money scores. Period.
QVq3ttlp0bI,The defense of Juve had a real bad day.
QVq3ttlp0bI,Wolfsburg and Bayern destroying Italian teams. You love to see it
QVq3ttlp0bI,"Juve's GK made several excellent saves, but it wasn't enough to discourage Bayern...🤨🤐😏"
QVq3ttlp0bI,"Alara Şehitler, remember the name"
QVq3ttlp0bI,"It's funny that English speaking people pronounce the letters u like ü and ü like u. Her name is not Buhl but Bühl! And yes, English speaking people can also say ü. They say that all the time on ""Uber"""
QVq3ttlp0bI,Congrats Bayern ❤🎉
QVq3ttlp0bI,XHULI what a beautiful @rsch 🔥🙆‍♂️
QVq3ttlp0bI,Thanks

GnfsbGobH38,"Just make the goals smaller. You can't be having goalkeepers getting lobbed from on their line from 12 yards out, they already can't catch"
GnfsbGobH38,Juve following AS Roma in form and ability. No where……..keep practising.

6RMX6lO2sgY,A GOLAZO by the way 😂🇹🇩🇲🇦
OmEfo0t3hFk,"Jonsdottir is almost like Wolfsburg's Lewandowski. Funnily, he scored his five goals in eight minutes namely against Wolfsburg.

I was very disappointed to see almost every goal being caused by insane mistakes in defense, though. That couldn't be Champions League level"
OmEfo0t3hFk,Incredible night for Jónsdóttir. It's like everything she hit went in.
OmEfo0t3hFk,4:00 it was already over !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OmEfo0t3hFk,She Wolves 😊😊.... I supposed the mens team is referred to as He Wolves or not??
OmEfo0t3hFk,Wowow… AS Roma get smashed…😅
OmEfo0t3hFk,"First ever hat-trick for Sveindís in her professional club career - and what a time to get one! 🤩😎
been following her since watching her play against Barcelona couple of years back. shes incredible"
OmEfo0t3hFk,"Took her 20 minutes to get to #2 in the top scorer list, what a legend"
OmEfo0t3hFk,"The way Italian women have declined over past couple of seasons is sad after the promise shown from 2019 to 2022. Technical nations like Italy & Portugal, even Spain, need to find taller, faster & stronger players locally to make an impact internationally. Specially 1.8M goalie and efficient strikers. Physicality of the she-Wolves finally broke down the relatively petite Italians.
More work needs to be done by the Wolfsburg defense. Not clearing the ball properly under pressure inside the box needs to be addressed. The decisive goal in final against Barca & the reply by Roma in this match being 2 examples of panicking in tight spaces."
OmEfo0t3hFk,"Really disappointed with Roma this season. Felt like they really held their own last time round, but they really seem to be struggling with the level in the UWCL. Sadly that has been true across the board this year, as we've seen some ridiculous scorelines just in the group stages. Disappointing as you want matches to be as competitive as possible."
OmEfo0t3hFk,Jónsdóttir is wonderful player 🔥
OmEfo0t3hFk,"An extraordinary night for Wolfsburg and particularly Sveindís Jane Jónsdóttir, an eventful one to be on commentary for, to score four goals as a substitute is incredible! You might have noticed I primarily refer to her as 'Sveindís Jane' not 'Jónsdóttir' as one would for say a German player by default. That's because German names are formally shortened to the surname. Icelandic names are formally shortened to the first name. The name “Yonsdóttir” is not a surname; it’s a patronymic. It identifies who the person’s father is. In this case, literally, the person is “Svayndees Jane, daughter of Yons” It would be considered inappropriate in Iceland - and indeed sexist — to shorten a woman’s name to “daughter of Yons”. In the context of a women’s professional footballer, referring to each player primarily by the name of her father, not by her own name, would be considered highly sexist in Iceland.

The result means Wolfsburg are into the quarter-finals for a 12th season in 13, last season the only exception. The She-Wolves have also won eight of their last nine games. For AS Roma, it's the second time in a row they have been been drawn in a really tough group, and missed out on reaching the knockouts, so the priority now becomes retaining the Italian Serie A League and Coppa Italia cup domestic double they won last season."
OmEfo0t3hFk,First ever hat-trick for Sveindís in her professional club career - and what a time to get one! 🤩😎
OmEfo0t3hFk,Four goals is is absolutely crazy

Dfpbp28iV-0,"Jonsdottir auf den Spuren von Lewandowski. Viererpack, Woman of the match"
Dfpbp28iV-0,"Jónsdóttir onslaught with 4 goals in 25 minutes! Take a bow!
Also a masterful goal by Popp to open the floodgates only 5+ minutes into the game, and Beerensteyn's strike after great series of passing for a wonderful team goal to break the deadlock.... What a match! ⚽🐺🟢
-red."
Dfpbp28iV-0,Player 23 absolutely crushed that making easily those 4 gols. Rome are eliminated already

l-OCpmL-XpY,The ladys 2 goals are better than some mens goals. She is the number 1 best player for women in the world right now. Those goals are impossible
l-OCpmL-XpY,"All respect to Hamarbys girls👏👍❤, and well done to MC girls👍🤟."
l-OCpmL-XpY,Record for a women’s club game. Not all time high for any women’s game but one of the best in total too.
l-OCpmL-XpY,"Throwing an object (likely a coin) at a player is disgusting, disgraceful and dangerous behaviour.

oumbrKzmJ1o,"Poppi would definitely still be incredible for the Nationalelf, perhaps there might be a tiny chance she'll reconsider closer to the Euros, the national team coach will probably try out several different players upfront leading up the Euros but there's no one better than Popp, what an incredible player, also Frohms is still a world-class women's keeper and should also still be an international."

LWXk7i8sqgs,bayern tolle mannschft
CdaiLnn4Wbo,Why aren't the full matches uploaded to YouTube? Why limit the number of viewers with your junk app
mbWrTNvbKoc,That isn't a foul at all.
mbWrTNvbKoc,"Wasn’t able to watch the game live but from the highlights it looked like an absolute cracking match. Shame they wouldn’t let the game be held at the BayArena, like it deserved to be."
iDKuNK4Slpk,HipHip Hurra
KgfQIVUd9tM,"It's extremely unfair with red card. To me, you will get a yellow card if you intentionally play foul 3 times, a red card if you do it 5 times. In case of potentially scoring, red card if you obviously play foul."
KgfQIVUd9tM,whiskey
KgfQIVUd9tM,"I don't get it, she (Mickenhagen) won the ball. Ref cost Leverkusen the 3 points."
KgfQIVUd9tM,"I find it really hard to watch these games and not just be angry at how unequal the whole thing is. The way the commentator acts as if these are two equal teams, when it’s far from that. Leverkusen have to play out of their skin to beat the them with all the star names. And it’s hardly some big achievement when Bayern came back. Even without the second yellow, it was always likely that the higher quality team would come back and win the game. We need some honesty about how unequal this sport is. Rather than papering over it by pretending it’s a fair contest. It isn’t."
KgfQIVUd9tM,"Who is the commentator? He did great,"
KgfQIVUd9tM,Great game!
KgfQIVUd9tM,2:18:26 - 2:18:37 exactly my thoughts on the 2nd yellow. Egregious.
KgfQIVUd9tM,"Ok, after rewatching the foul that lead to the second yellow card for Mickenhagen, I have to admit that it was a wrong decision. The penalty decision was surely right, though"
KgfQIVUd9tM,Excellent commentator; called the game really well.Top bloke.
osekZ-o7a7w,"Where did OL find this number 6? She's too powerful, technical, and fast. I love her vision of the game; she must be from Barcelona at all costs."
osekZ-o7a7w,"Heads up She Wolves! Second place behind Lyon is still possible. Galatasaray twice coming up next, that should be an easier task to complete. With regained self confidence, there will be new possibilities against AS Roma home.

PS nobody's talking about Bara because 1. she was not on the field and 2. the visitors of this channel prefer to talk about women's football."
osekZ-o7a7w,"Lyon wasting golden opportunities like Barca.
Going to be an interesting UWCL this season."

wY68x3kF_QA,I refuse to watch every match where the results are given before watching it.
wY68x3kF_QA,"DAZN, stop showing the results in the thumbnails or titles please"
wY68x3kF_QA,We were beaten because of sheer lapses in concentration. The goal difference would not have been this high
wY68x3kF_QA,Arsenal humiliated...

wY68x3kF_QA,Arsenal are clueless and tha coach should never have been given an extension…should be shipped back to Sweden.
wY68x3kF_QA,Only Chelsea at the weekend.🙄
wY68x3kF_QA,Arsenal were caught between a rock and Pernille Harder.
wY68x3kF_QA,gonna get absolutely slapped by chelsea this weekend 😵
wY68x3kF_QA,"Harder was brilliant not bad for a 31 year old player, arsenal have lots of older players who are not a match to her, cant see them beating chelsea on saturday, ive been an arsenal fan all my life both men and women,ive seen kids play better football than them"
wY68x3kF_QA,"Man, always delivering against top teams"
wY68x3kF_QA,Please use English
wY68x3kF_QA,Who’s winning the Woman’s champions league?❤
_NFnX02Mumc,"This bayern team is so perfect

Imagine Oberdorf comes back with stanway and Sarah midfield trio with Lohman and Buhl on wings with Harder upfront 
this attack will be ruthless"
_NFnX02Mumc,Tromp Path
_NFnX02Mumc,7:06 horrendous marking.
_NFnX02Mumc,Arsenal need a better keeper. Been saying this for years now
_NFnX02Mumc,that goal celebration music is terrible. it's a football match not a circus
_NFnX02Mumc,Hatrick Harder in 15mins - Mind Blowing!!!
_NFnX02Mumc,"And I just popped in here real quick to thank you for your infinite wisdom of putting THE SCORE IN THE TITLE!
Now I don't have to search your channel for the actual game, or even watch the rest of this clip - Brilliant, well done you 😏"
_NFnX02Mumc,It seems like Pernille Harder has been scoring Champions League goals in pairs
_NFnX02Mumc,No player interviews? I wanna hear what leah williamson thought what happened in the game
_NFnX02Mumc,"On paper you may be inclined to think this was a meeting of two giants of the game, the thing is Arsenal women's have only recently become one of the ""bigger sides"" of the Women's Super League, and haven't got a reputation in Europe yet, they just have their name and the fact their men's side is regarded as one of the better teams in European football, however Arsenal women's is an up and comer, whatever they achieve this season will be something the look to build on next season.

Man City and Chelsea are the real CL contenders of the English teams, Arsenal will probably reach the quarter-final at most, which would be a respectable showing for them."
_NFnX02Mumc,The Harder they certainly come!!
_NFnX02Mumc,Arsenal allways disapoints.
_NFnX02Mumc,Harder and her headers 👏
_NFnX02Mumc,You cannot blame the keeper for that shocking marking jheeez
_NFnX02Mumc,A result like that makes it look like Jonas has lost the dressing room! What's he signed the former Villa keeper to be there no 1 and she's on the bench for the champions league games?? 😮
_NFnX02Mumc,Nearly 60% of the goals were scored from set-pieces and were headers.
_NFnX02Mumc,"This is what happens when you rely on Zinsberger as your keeper. Drop the dead weight. Zinsberger, Foorde and Jonas OUT."
_NFnX02Mumc,pernille harder the great dane!!🤩
_NFnX02Mumc,Arsenal needs to deal with goalkeeping issues.
_NFnX02Mumc,"just saying yeah, they let viv go. They lose to bayern. Man city winning freakin Barcelona. I'm so happy viv came to city - she deserves a quality team to support her."
_NFnX02Mumc,Does this channel wants people to start paying for Livestreme
_NFnX02Mumc,Shocking defending from the girls I have said it before and will say it again Arsenal need a top-class goalkeeper and should have persisted in their pursuit of Mary Earps.
_NFnX02Mumc,Jonas is making a talented squad look so slow and stale
_NFnX02Mumc,That was impressive!!
_NFnX02Mumc,"Arsenal coach needs to gooooooooooooooooo😢
Am sick of all this near success syndrome."
_NFnX02Mumc,If someone has Casey Stoney's number. Give her a ring she maybe needed in the coming weeks
_NFnX02Mumc,Harder was playing against a poor Arsenal defence. Can’t keep blaming the coach and keeper. Big name  defence players look slow and play accordingly.
_NFnX02Mumc,I don’t understand why we didn’t win
_NFnX02Mumc,Embarrassing performance. To collapse like that shows a weak mentality
_NFnX02Mumc,We just need JONAS out !
_NFnX02Mumc,Leaving barca for that garbage can u just imagine wow
_NFnX02Mumc,Did arsenal decide to stop playing
_NFnX02Mumc,The amount of goals Arsenal concede from crosses is crazy.. Jonas has to go he just can't get this team to click.
_NFnX02Mumc,Some things never change
_NFnX02Mumc,"This manager is clueless letting Viv go is going to haunt you, irreplaceable talent"
_NFnX02Mumc,"It's crazy how fast people are jumping on the blame Jonas wagon & how ignorant everyone are when Arsenal is facing Germany's best Football team, you expected a walkover?. You are not in WSL anymore, you're facing the best teams in the world, so before pointing fingers, look in the mirror."
_NFnX02Mumc,"Wow what a game that was, I genuinely needed a lie down in a darkened room to get my breath back after commentating on that I was so knackered! 🤣Bayern keep up their perfect start, 7 wins in 7 this season across all competitions, and travel to Wolfsburg this weekend full of confidence. A different story for Arsenal, who most quickly turn their attention back to a massive home lunch Saturday league game against English reigning champions Chelsea. Speaking of Chelsea, it was former Blues striker who did the damage tonight, her 1st UWCL goals in almost two years and for her new club Bayern. Also I make it the first time Arsenal have conceded five in a competitive game in seven years or so! 🤯"
_NFnX02Mumc,3:20 What a pass from Stanway
_NFnX02Mumc,I'm not sure whether Arsenal has no goalkeeper or defence kodwa some's lacking laphaya emuva
_NFnX02Mumc,Hope arsenal play like this on Saturday
_NFnX02Mumc,once a blue always a blue 💙
_NFnX02Mumc,"Spoiler alert they showed results, it gets to me 😭"
_NFnX02Mumc,"When Bayern meet arsenal 😂😂😂
You know what going to happen 😂😂😂"
_NFnX02Mumc,Bayern 😂 always thrash arsenal 😂😂😂
_NFnX02Mumc,Why did they take off McCabe
_NFnX02Mumc,imagine not betting on this
_NFnX02Mumc,"wow, who would've thought bara bet was on point with the &quot;pernille harder show&quot; prediction... do they have a crystal ball or something? 🤔"
_NFnX02Mumc,Who's here from bara bet??
_NFnX02Mumc,crazy how no one's talking about the bara bet free picks
_NFnX02Mumc,Pernille is proper Chels 💙
_NFnX02Mumc,Be Careful What You Wish For
_NFnX02Mumc,Can we stop blaming Jonas These goals were clearing Players fault
_NFnX02Mumc,LOVELY .KEEP JONAS.WE CAN GET BACK TO CHEAP TICKETS AND BOREHAM WOOD WITH 2000 SUPPORTERS.LOVELY
_NFnX02Mumc,"The Gunners were clearly out of ammunition, they were woeful! 

How is the manager still in the job? He's useless, tactically inept!"
_NFnX02Mumc,Commentator say goals coming like London buses wait.for 1 and 2 or 3 comes 🔥💯🤣🤣
_NFnX02Mumc,"Arsenal goalkeeper remained frozen in so many occasions. Why did they sign Daphne van Domselaar, to keep her benched?"
_NFnX02Mumc,Once again an English club robbed by cheating Germans!!
_NFnX02Mumc,"love this commentator

7:05 ""champion's league goals for pernille harder are like london buses. you wait for one and two come at once""
7:37 ""bayern are cooking here"""
_NFnX02Mumc,It was the Pernille Harder show and loved ever minute of it
_NFnX02Mumc,"Our players look so lazy, what are they doing in training?"
_NFnX02Mumc,"He changes the team almost every game,  what he is really doing 😂.  Sack him by tomorrow morning"
_NFnX02Mumc,He should be sacked by tomorrow morning.
_NFnX02Mumc,"Arsenal have given Jonas everything he's asked for. Players (almost all internationals), backroom staff, even the Emirates stadium for home games. Yet looking at the team you cannot identify any meaningful style of play. Strikers who are scared to shoot; no build-up; no zeal. He's had three years to put his stamp on the team but I always suspected the team was too big for him. The team needs a proper coach cos a side packed full of established internationals shldn't be struggling this badly."
_NFnX02Mumc,"Pernille makes Arsenal's life a lot ""Harder""... 
Sydney makes Arsenal go down ""loh, Mann""... ;)"
_NFnX02Mumc,"a SHAME!!!! zinsberger ""the statue"" has once again lived up to its name!!!! Actually, I never thought that Eidevall should be out, but what he's been putting on the pitch lately is subterranean!!!! Chelsea will blow us apart this weekend!!!!

eine SCHANDE!!!! zinsberger ""the statue"" hat ihrem namen mal wieder alle ehre gemacht!!!! eigentlich war ich nie der meinug dass eidevall raus sollte aber was der in letzter zeit auf den platz stellt ist unterirdisch!!!! chelsea wird uns am wochenende in der luft zerreisen!!!!"
_NFnX02Mumc,"Very disappointing result tonight ladies, far from the standards required to compete at this level. I’m sorry but Arsenal Ladies have gone backwards, we’ve not started very in the WSL and this disastrous result compounds where this team is heading. Others teams in WSL have improved, but like Mikel Arteta I DO NOT ACCEPT THESE POOR STANDARDS 😡"
_NFnX02Mumc,Terrible 2nd half after a terrible result in WSL on weekend. Sorry persisting with Eidevall is ridiculous for me
_NFnX02Mumc,I think Jonas Edieval do not have the right ideas to compete at the highest level. Arsenal had no answer to the athleticism of BM ..tat's why  the Arsenal players simply could not keep up with Bayern team after a decent start.
_NFnX02Mumc,"Bayern introduced themselves into the League in 1970, although they had been playing since 1970, but the DFB would not let Women into a League from 1955 to 1970.
Bayern W did not taker themselves seriously at all and didn't really until 2011, when it was decided that, like the Men, to become the best.
Bayern W have been living in Wolfsburg's W shadow, but that has all changed over the last 2 or so Seasons.
As far as the CL goes, we have not been one of the best Teams, but that is now changing too and to trounce Arsenal as we did tonight, proves that it is.
We have come a long way in the last 13, or so years and signed some fantastic Players and I am proud of that win tonight.
Also, not lost on me, was Harder being instrumental in pulling Arsenal W apart tonight...an ex Chelsea Player :0)
Well done ladies!
Onward and upward."
_NFnX02Mumc,Joe Montemurro won the WSL title with a team decimated by injury. Jonas has put together some of the best players around. And they are getting worse.
_NFnX02Mumc,Bayern wins @ home!
_NFnX02Mumc,Arsenal men's team gonna be having flashbacks after seeing this result
_NFnX02Mumc,Eiderval doesnt know what hes doing. Zinsberger is useless
M9D2P5aS1X8,LOVELY .KEEP JONAS.WE CAN GET BACK TO CHEAP TICKETS AND BOREHAM WOON WITH 2000 SUPPORTERS.LOVELY
M9D2P5aS1X8,It’s ok guys it’s just the first game of the tournament
M9D2P5aS1X8,Arsenal one of the best squad both quality and quantity. But they just dont seem to get it together. So sad.
M9D2P5aS1X8,"Poor how u couldn't stream the city game,smh"
M9D2P5aS1X8,Nice keep it up Jonas I want you to put this team in 8 position in wsl and out of champions League
M9D2P5aS1X8,"Appreciate the stream, thank u dazn"
M9D2P5aS1X8,"What has gone wrong with Arsenal?  With that squad, there is nothing to show."

KEPwKqBVVSo,"I commented at the end of last season that I had wanted Manchester City to win the league to see them in the UCL. They did get there and who better than Barcelona, who I have watched since the English players went there from City, but not forgetting the other teams too. Interesting for Keira Walsh."

KEPwKqBVVSo,Barcelona vs Real Madrid in the final;)
KEPwKqBVVSo,"Hammarby has the best crowd, a bit of a shame they could not get to play Arsenal. Man Citys arena is too small for Hammarbys away fans just as Benficas was."
KEPwKqBVVSo,Come on Arsenal!
KEPwKqBVVSo,"women's football is more evenly flexible than men's football , men's football is too eager to have a career in Europe especially the top 5 Europe leagues but not women's football ; almost all confederations have quality competitions , maybe only Oceania is still behind the other 5 confederations , women's football players career will definitely get better because they are more evenly flexible and does not depend on football competitions in Europe ."

JXpEYUPFJ5w,"I know a lot of people will hate me for this, but I would have been happier if Caldentey stayed instead of Putellas. but the bigger problem is that there are a lot of super girls in Barca B but there are very few spots for team A"
JXpEYUPFJ5w,"pararuelo, halland woman version"
JXpEYUPFJ5w,"Why should the club let Mariona go, she has a lot to offer."
JXpEYUPFJ5w,Whats numbers Aitana????
JXpEYUPFJ5w,Did they lift the trophy today?
JXpEYUPFJ5w,Why did they sub Mariona on her last game. She should have played the whole game.
JXpEYUPFJ5w,Both Salma and Caro are the top scorers of Liga F with 20 goals.
JXpEYUPFJ5w,So great to see Mapi smiling on the pitch again!
axiUgUuaSP8,In the first goal I think Lyon made a mistake Renard should have gone to stay in front of Bonnati when she saw her running on that side to intimidate her and possibly steal the ball from her. Instead she was more to the side when Bonmati was close to the goal.
axiUgUuaSP8,Vamos Barca biggest club in the world
axiUgUuaSP8,"Barcelona finally beating Lyon and with goals from Bonmati and Putellas, a perfect story without a doubt.
Bonmati is the best player in the world for the second year, and I have no doubt that she will obtain her second Ballon d'Or not only for what she did with Barcelona but also for what she did with Spain, winning the Nations League and now the Olympic Games."
axiUgUuaSP8,"Barcelona is a team that normalizes the extraordinary. They achieved 4 titles this season when no other team, neither male nor female, could do so. 
They are writing the great history of this sport and I have no doubt that this will continue because it has the best players in the world."
axiUgUuaSP8,Aitana bonmati the best player in the world!
axiUgUuaSP8,Great one
axiUgUuaSP8,I MY CLUB LOVE YOU WINS THE BEST

Note: we are non professional.😂"
axiUgUuaSP8,Alexia Putellas only needed 3 minutes 😮‍💨 what a player 🐐👸🏼
axiUgUuaSP8,"Barcelona femeni are like Bayern Munich's main squad, making their league more of a farmer's league."

-OiOrBFpFgo,A very two sided match. Could have gone either way. Lyon had their fair share of chances. Really entertaining. Watched it 5 months later. Falling deeply in love with women's football.
-OiOrBFpFgo,Haan bhai 4RA ke community events ne to sabko ek saath le aaya hai
-OiOrBFpFgo,"Bhai 4ra pe live betting karke alag hi thrill hai, T20 World Cup pe toh aur bhi mast hoga"

-OiOrBFpFgo,if princess Diani  is playing chances are either  win or tough 0-0
-OiOrBFpFgo,Thier win only 14 ucl in thiere historiy real Madrid
-OiOrBFpFgo,I love Miedema's stance
-OiOrBFpFgo,7.05  that jacket looks so big and uncomfortable at the shoulders 😂
-OiOrBFpFgo,i'm never watching women's football again 😭😭😭
-OiOrBFpFgo,The arrogance of LYO is beyond _______!???
-OiOrBFpFgo,Aitana is the best player for my opinion
-OiOrBFpFgo,Bonmati and Putellas. What the players !
-OiOrBFpFgo,"What a great team. What a great footballers  🙏🏼 
Thats why We will always love our beautiful iconic Legends Club and thats no doubt the Champions of sixtiple is here to stay again 🙏
FCBARCELONA 4LIFE 💪❤💙"
-OiOrBFpFgo,why does it look like they are playing on slow motion ?

-OiOrBFpFgo,"Barcelona the best team at the moment, wow I love their style of play. And look at these crowds an the fans, this is very organise too, they have fan zone and other entertainment, like they said they were there 5hrs before the game, wow amazing."
-OiOrBFpFgo,"Hello ,🙏 Once more for playing football as soon.❤️❤️❤️ I love you.😷🤙🇳🇵👋"
-OiOrBFpFgo,Viv was very beautiful.
-OiOrBFpFgo,Great football great match
-OiOrBFpFgo,Perfect
-OiOrBFpFgo,"Lucy broze is Solid! Amazing player, not taking away from Aitana i love her, however The defense the back 5, absolutely put their best performance this season 🔥🔥🔥🔥🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆 and Barcelona club is Massive, look at this final how well organize and the fans ❤❤❤❤"
-OiOrBFpFgo,At least women makes us proud
-OiOrBFpFgo,"Lyon turned out to be very poor losers: Immediately removed their medals and didn't line up to form a guard of honour, as Barcelona had done for them in Turin. That's a resounding BOOO from me. 🤮"
-OiOrBFpFgo,Caroline Graham Hansen is the women of the match. She was electifying.
-OiOrBFpFgo,Barca will win it for the consecutive five seasons
-OiOrBFpFgo,Barca was denied a quadruple last season when they were eliminated from the copa del Reina after winning 8-0
-OiOrBFpFgo,Aitana GOATmatí. The one and only
-OiOrBFpFgo,Graham Hansen and Bonmati running circles around the Lyon defence. What a pair!
-OiOrBFpFgo,Why did Endler get the yellow in the 98th minute?
-OiOrBFpFgo,Best club in the world 🌎🏆🏆🏆💞💞💞
-OiOrBFpFgo,both teams can ball that‘s sure the goal and celebration is one for the history books
-OiOrBFpFgo,"2:56:05 Saving time stamp for me to visit again in the future. What a legendary moment.
Reminds me of ""Aguerrooo..."" 🤩🤩"
-OiOrBFpFgo,"The overall quality in this game was exceptionally poor. The goals were well taken, but the game itself was shocking."
-OiOrBFpFgo,"Damaris shouldn't be too sad, she has won it before at least."
-OiOrBFpFgo,One Big Team Work. I love Barca :)
-OiOrBFpFgo,All the girls played a great game. Congratulations to them 🙏
-OiOrBFpFgo,Ona even got wound on her face but she's still a brave warrior
-OiOrBFpFgo,Lucy Bronze is the player of the match for me.
-OiOrBFpFgo,"Aitana, the magician"
-OiOrBFpFgo,Jana so sweet and pretty girl 😘
-OiOrBFpFgo,Salma Paralluelo had a very bad game. Almost nonexistent. I think she should have been replaced on half time with Claudia Pina. Pins is fantastic on keeping the ball in the 18th yard.
-OiOrBFpFgo,Barca's defence owned Lyon today. Any of them were most deserving of POTM
-OiOrBFpFgo,Barcelona forever 💕
-OiOrBFpFgo,"First goal: 2:23:49
Second goal: 2:56:21
An unbelievable victory against a very strong team. Visca El Barca!!!!"
-OiOrBFpFgo,"At 59:47, they raised up the Palestine 🇵🇸 flag and people started cheering. It's so wild that they didn't show it properly and panned the camera towards the players instead"
-OiOrBFpFgo,"2:39:22 ona batle injury 
2:49:50 this dribbling by aitana and brugs 😮‍💨"

We're champions again🔥

-OiOrBFpFgo,"Amazing match, seeing ingrid engens imrpovement makes me super happy, Aitana was amazing of course but i also think Cata Coll and Graham Hansen got a bit overshadowed, their work was insane! But  everyone in the Barcelona team is incedible, no weak spot!"
-OiOrBFpFgo,Lucy Bronze and Fridolina Rolfö made it possible. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇸🇪
-OiOrBFpFgo,It is fantastic! This team never tires of winning! Barça Femeni is the best club in the world today! 🔴🔵🔴🔵Visca El Barsa!🔴🔵🔴🔵 Congratulations to all fans on another victory! 👍 🍾💥 🏆🏆🏆
-OiOrBFpFgo,I love Barcelona and i can not really explain the reason
-OiOrBFpFgo,THIS IS CINEMA ♥️💙♥️💙♥️💙♥️💙♥️
-OiOrBFpFgo,i would say earning all that money for doing what you love is even better than winning😂
-OiOrBFpFgo,What a match💕
-OiOrBFpFgo,Laporta better hug Lucy tight and  dont let her go
-OiOrBFpFgo,"What a game... AITANA was the Goat again, Brugts pointing out that the ball had to go to Putellas (nobody mentioned this)... Walsh and Paredes outstanding.., Bronze and CGH brilliant...  So gutted for Aguerolla not winning in her Basque-region."
-OiOrBFpFgo,congratulations to Barcelona and bye bye for Jonatan Giraldez go to Washington Spirit in NWSL
-OiOrBFpFgo,DAZN Men Fooball with UEFA Women’s Champions League Final 2024 for free too here on YT OR is this pure hypocrisy??? THat´s what I though.
-OiOrBFpFgo,"While Aitana & Alexia are under the spotlight, I give high credit to Keira. She did terrific job in the midfield. Congratulations, Barcelona."

gsNBBHQutp4,Brilliant player  best player ever
gsNBBHQutp4,great players are great .... but great players that show up when the team needs them the most and put the team on their back are another level ... this type player can become the best of all time!

Mrj5Pa7krpU,SK Brann keeper needs to find herself a better team
Mrj5Pa7krpU,Gaham is the best player
Mrj5Pa7krpU,Best team itw!
Mrj5Pa7krpU,She might not have got a G/A but she dominated and created the most chances.... CGH 😍😍😍
Mrj5Pa7krpU,Barça should get the Brann goalkeeper. She's been spectacular in both games.
Mrj5Pa7krpU,"The queen of football is back
Alexia"
Mrj5Pa7krpU,Graham Hansen's close in dribbling skills are simply amazing.
Mrj5Pa7krpU,Graham  is too much ❤❤
Mrj5Pa7krpU,"For the life of me I do not understand why every men and women soccer team isn't trying to emulate Spain's women soccer game - that includes the players for Barcelona and Real Madrid. The game they play is technical, surgical and a pleasure to watch even when they haven't scored. If I was coaching either the Men's or Women's USA National teams, we'd be watching hours of film and adopt their style!"
Mrj5Pa7krpU,"real madrid last four matches vs barca 0 goals
brann vs barca two matches 2 goals😂😂😂"
Mrj5Pa7krpU,The best club
Mrj5Pa7krpU,"Caroline Graham Hansen is a true game maker, her specialist in assist, fantastic dribbler..❤❤"
Mrj5Pa7krpU,Graham is mbappe in women football!
Mrj5Pa7krpU,"The Messi of FCB Femini- Caroline Graham Hansen❤

Just look at the making of second and third goal."
Mrj5Pa7krpU,"In this match, there are a lot of unnecessary individual actions, which even eliminate scoring opportunities"
Mrj5Pa7krpU,Chelsea gonna beat this Barcelona hands down 😂 Barcelona feminine are going home this time around.
Mrj5Pa7krpU,02:37 scripting...typical ea fc rebound
Mrj5Pa7krpU,They are always playing outstanding
Mrj5Pa7krpU,equal pay boys 🤣🤣🤣
Mrj5Pa7krpU,The best team of all the world
Mrj5Pa7krpU,I don’t want Aitana’s consistent performances and g/a outshine CGH✨
Mrj5Pa7krpU,But how can Barça miss so many goals?????😩😫😩😫😩😫😩
Mrj5Pa7krpU,"Caroline, you're looking sharp."
Mrj5Pa7krpU,Caroline Graham Hansen for Ballon D'or ! ⚽⚽🏅🏅
Mrj5Pa7krpU,wasteful barca...need to improve vs chelsea..
5_dwhcvsjcw,Watching this game on DAZN feels like winning a VIP trip to the Final without leaving my couch! 😄⚽
yUh3jJLgBVw,I love Lyon ❤🎉❤🎉
yUh3jJLgBVw,Women's football has become something else ... entirely!
yUh3jJLgBVw,This is the way to play football. The assists alone would put this in the textbooks.
yUh3jJLgBVw,"3 German goals, not so bad...."
yUh3jJLgBVw,horan my monster
yUh3jJLgBVw,Dumornay great assist
02PyoEM4e5Q,"Impressive to see the great saves by Brann’s GK…and nicely done to get one behind  Barca’s GK!  I think the cooler climate affects Barca’s play.  Either way, it was impressive to see the score only 2-1,  considering how they have shattered world class teams! 
Sweden surely gave our Canadian women’s team a massive brain and body workout at Tokyo, and it was finally won by Canada due to PKs.  Now, we see Norway’s talent coming forth and providing even more GREAT football!

Great work!  Hope to see a game between Canada and Norway soon!

Cheers!🇨🇦⚽🇮🇸"
02PyoEM4e5Q,I’ll always root for the Scandinavian underdogs! Brann and Häcken are top tier teams!!
02PyoEM4e5Q,"Aitana Bonmatí is easily the best jeez

What a player!"
02PyoEM4e5Q,"Brann, and Häcken, has exceeded all expectations. With the conditions these teams have, they are real winners. 👏🏻💪🏻"
02PyoEM4e5Q,If not for Brann GK the scoreline would have been a lot different... My appreciation for the GK
02PyoEM4e5Q,"why is barca not streamed live in my country 
.....i need answer pls"
02PyoEM4e5Q,"home away It will be end like roma before, mark my word."
02PyoEM4e5Q,The equaliser and the celebrations 😃😃♥
02PyoEM4e5Q,The goal from bran is completely defensive error.. no one marked her.. and of course credit to them .. goal executed perfectly..
02PyoEM4e5Q,no 10 of barca  too greedyyyy
02PyoEM4e5Q,Respect for Brann goalkeeper
02PyoEM4e5Q,Girls football is delicious
02PyoEM4e5Q,One Team that will give me the cherry on top. Beating Lyon
02PyoEM4e5Q,swore that bronze header was going in
02PyoEM4e5Q,There is no VAR in women soccer or FC Barcelona doesn't deserve any penalty? This is just insane.
02PyoEM4e5Q,"If Brann score first in the return leg, that opens things up completely. But I think Barcelona will go up a couple of gears."
02PyoEM4e5Q,This Brann team will easily destroy Manchester united women
02PyoEM4e5Q,"Aitana Bonmatí is easily the best jeez

What a player!"
02PyoEM4e5Q,"A fantastic effort by SK Brann and the performance was one of concentration, effort, ability and bar a few possession errors and passing a great team effort to be proud of. WELL DONE . Barca a bit off the beat in this one."
02PyoEM4e5Q,"Brann, and Häcken, has exceeded all expectations. With the conditions these teams have, they are real winners. 👏🏻💪🏻"
02PyoEM4e5Q,Mikalsen was the MVP.  absolutely. Forca Barca
02PyoEM4e5Q,Paid VAR in favour of Brannn....
02PyoEM4e5Q,The reaction from Brann's goalscorer was beautifully authentic. I loved it.
02PyoEM4e5Q,"#GibraltarWaveFC will be the first FC in the world to not only have a cryptocurrency, #CateCoin on its shirt front but also accept sponsorship payment in #CateCoin
Press Release in sports, financial sponsorship, cryptocurrency and general press"
02PyoEM4e5Q,Brann defence was impressive against the European heavyweight's + to score against Barcelona is impressive but facing Barcelona in Spain is a different kettle of fish watched by fired up Spanish fan's in the Barca stadium! i can only see 1 outcome = Barca go through to the Final!❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💙! VAMOS BARCA!!
02PyoEM4e5Q,"Barcelona dominated the entire 90 minutes, Brann had only one chance. The score should be 1-5.
But I liked Brann, they're great"
02PyoEM4e5Q,Barcelona had a difficult game in the Viking north at -5°C. Glad they won somehow. 😊❤
02PyoEM4e5Q,I love that equalizer goal 😘😋😀😁
02PyoEM4e5Q,"I felt Brann was mostly defeated in the physical aspects of the game and in addition they dissolved so easily defensively. Had they been more resilient and more decisive passing and defending, the game would've been more in balance"
02PyoEM4e5Q,I’m impressed with the coordination from Brann. It takes a lot of defensive synchrony to marshall a result like this. Kudos to the goalie too
02PyoEM4e5Q,Once barca men played a great game but today 😂😂😂and
02PyoEM4e5Q,"congratulations to te fans,,,nice job of them"
02PyoEM4e5Q,Barcelona quick and accurate passing is unmatched 😮
02PyoEM4e5Q,Stream it live next time aholes
02PyoEM4e5Q,The Brann Player saw the first goal coming. 😂
02PyoEM4e5Q,6:27  Perfect example on how huge accomplish is to score against Barca.
02PyoEM4e5Q,"It's just the beginning of barca struggeling.
Just wait for Sjoeke Nüsken with her new job as Sam Kerr, dear Barca defense 🤗"
02PyoEM4e5Q,An important away win for Barcelona Femeni. Tough game but they came out victorious
02PyoEM4e5Q,How can they play such complicated football with so ease ? I'm amazed at the fluency at which they can operate through intricate passes ! 😮😮
02PyoEM4e5Q,If not for Brann GK the scoreline would have been a lot different... My appreciation for the GK 👏👏👏
02PyoEM4e5Q,What a match! All that furious almost put me on my knews... (figurative words) but the future is strong! the objectives first... clear example! Wow... admiration only!
02PyoEM4e5Q,Brann and Hacken showed that underdogs can compete 👋🏻
02PyoEM4e5Q,*Im not surprised. Why are ppl so surprised with this score? Y’all expect barac to dominate outside of their league but that didn’t happen.*
02PyoEM4e5Q,Well this is a surprising score line.

NcRqnqgPWvM,Gotta love her honesty! Hope she will stay in Frankfurt. 🇦🇹
NcRqnqgPWvM,"Q1. Team Yui Hasegawa.. Yui Hasegawa will carry Manchester City into The Uefa Champions League group stage where Lucy Bronze, Georgia Stanway, Caroline Weir and Kiara Walsh have all failed.. Q2. Risa Shimizu carrying struggling Westham Utd up the WSL table.. Q3. Spanish G.O.A.T Lucia Garcia leaving Manchester United getting fed up of carrying them.. Q4. My younger bro, when he can be bothered.. Q5. Barcelona  because of Claudia Pina changed the game when she can on and Barcelona beat VFL Wolfsburg"
ap5uySWJnsI,"This could be upsetting but we might not see Entracht Frankfurt in next season Uefa Champions League since theyre in a 3rd place battle with Hoffenheim, SGS Essen, Werder Bremen, Bayer Leverkusen and Freiburg.. Entracht Frankfurt has slipped down to 4th place since Hoffenheim are winning 2-0 against strugglers Nurnberg"
-ksznnxPjJg,Why is that last goal in the video ? bit weird
-ksznnxPjJg,The only team can beat Barça...
-ksznnxPjJg,We are not in our best level in the UCL yet. The True War come with benefica.

-o94Z3Ju-8c,"Before 4 days Lyon and PSG gave us a masterclass of a game, and Barca in the same period lost their peak form and lost that extraordinary achievement of 80 straight wins in Johan. I know that someday in the future will regret that performance because they were awful. They were too passive and too soft without intensity and hunger to win at least in the 1st half."

pPuRdjV0Ly4,500% offside
pPuRdjV0Ly4,No way the 2nd goal is offsides when frueberg defender was in the eay snd went for the ball as well
yF73tS2fsLI,"DAZN as of now is just confusing. Which game you can watch where for free, from which country, etc.

Last week I tried to register for DAZN, first via the browser from PC, then via the app with Android (funnily enough, the app is in Dutch, here in Germany). Neither worked. Registration not possible. Goodbye women's football. UNFORTUNATELY!

But... well done, Frankfurt!
-> 5:0 with the B-Team (kind of)!"

EHG-xkrgPho,action
EHG-xkrgPho,The GK for Eintract was fantastic. It could easily been 4-0
EHG-xkrgPho,hansen can easily play among men
EHG-xkrgPho,That being said patri is one of the best footballers on planet
EHG-xkrgPho,Where is the English commentator?!
EHG-xkrgPho,"Liga F teams should take note of Frankfurts defending. But also make sure to attack not just defend.
Barca's weakness showed, so many players got silenced. Frankfurt frustrated them."
EHG-xkrgPho,Really disappointed that DAZN made no indication that they were broadcasting from their own site especially when the other Champions League games were on Youtube Channel.   ....... Just had a quick look on the DAZN site and further disappointment with the quality of the video and there is no option to improve it.  I felt like I was watching 480p  instead of the better quality shown on Youtube with the option to see at 1080p
EHG-xkrgPho,BARCELONA FEMENINO MUY TOP🤩
EHG-xkrgPho,Barça done the job but they lost many chances
EHG-xkrgPho,"Frankfurt defended well, and I was impressed with their ability to win the ball back from Barcelona in one on one battles. There were moments where they were on Barcelona’s level, But, wow, Paredes’ chest save at 1:36 was insane !!!"
EHG-xkrgPho,"anyone think Hansen is kind of similar with Messi in the way they both play the ball, how they dribbling, passing, and looks like Hansen scores  lot of goals from outside the box. superbb"
EHG-xkrgPho,The GK for Eintract was fantastic. It could easily been 4-0
EHG-xkrgPho,Caroline Grahan Hansen is the best player in the Wolrd!! ❤❤❤
EHG-xkrgPho,Too much quality on the Barcelona side.
EHG-xkrgPho,Paredes...1:36...very calm...keeper should have collected the ball once the chest trap had killed it
EHG-xkrgPho,WHY DID YOU NOT SHOW IT ?????????????
EHG-xkrgPho,"Not exactly a classic performance, but they got the job done. When are people going to realise that Lucy Bronze is the weak link in this team. Too often out of position, slow to track back, poor crossing, and too often giving the ball away. The sooner Rolfo returns and Batlle takes over at right back the better."

NaUGyN1qMRI,thank u DAZN for the streaming
NaUGyN1qMRI,I feel guilty because I was a bit critical of Paralluelo when Spain lost to Japan in the WWC. How did I not notice her ability?  Oops!
NaUGyN1qMRI,I think its time LAporta sign the women's coach for the men and sack Xavi
NaUGyN1qMRI,Congrats to our girls ❤❤❤
NaUGyN1qMRI,Your worst nightmare is when you first score Barcelona 😂
NaUGyN1qMRI,Barca look scary when they are down...u just can't contain their pressure...*the champs*
NaUGyN1qMRI,cant wait for barca vs lyon
NaUGyN1qMRI,"Frankfurt played SO well! But Barca just has this insane quality 🤯 Greetings from a Wolfsburg fan 🥲
P.S. May we talk about Ona Batlle's assist? I know, Sara isn't slow but Ona ... oof 😮"
NaUGyN1qMRI,Frankfurt played an excellent 1st half. They couldn't keep up that intensity for the whole 90 and Barca is just so talented all over the field.
NaUGyN1qMRI,Barca all the way ❤
NaUGyN1qMRI,"I'm an absolute Frauen-Bundesliga fan, you can't image how I jumped when Laura Freigang scored. It was an amazing match, both teams with a clear plan. Die Frankfurterinnen decidely came onto the pitch to play at equal levels with that outworldly Barcelona team. Couldn't believe how well Freigang, Dunst, Prasnikar, Hanshaw, Wolter and Anoymi did in this match. Respekt to Barcelona, and eternal love for Frauen-Bundesliga."

NaUGyN1qMRI,barca women destroy all opponents.no one can be equal to them. they play football at a different level.

NaUGyN1qMRI,"I'm Barça fan but this Frankfurt  play very well too, my respect to them."
NaUGyN1qMRI,Best women team by far
NaUGyN1qMRI,I just wish our men's team can play like this. 😢😢😢😢😢
NaUGyN1qMRI,Lyon > the rest
NaUGyN1qMRI,"Barca should sign Nicole Anyoi, she was top class in this game"
NaUGyN1qMRI,all the opponennts fight & fight & fight ... & still Barça always wins by playing beautifully .
NaUGyN1qMRI,"Salma is a lethal striker.
I think the coach plays her wrongly on wings even though she will still deliver. When she was moved in the middle, the goals came. Mariona is a winger also.
The coach should find balance and play them at their respective positions. We know how they played in their natural positions in the world cup"
NaUGyN1qMRI,Wonderfull Barcelona.❤

M4aT7TNk4MA,Laura Freigang would even do more in the men's national team than the men... Laura Freigang is the best player in the world and it was only thanks to her that Frankfurt were able to score a goal and if Barca wasn't that strong they could have gotten a draw.....
M4aT7TNk4MA,Indeed.. BARÇA FERMINE💙♥️ ARE REALLY AMAZING..❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🎉
M4aT7TNk4MA,Salma pushed❗ Barca back to Game 🤬
M4aT7TNk4MA,"My baby Salma. Much love for u ❤. Too much in form 🔥. This Barca team is a cheat 😅. Imagine adding Lauren James to this Barca team, they'll never loose any game ever lol."
M4aT7TNk4MA,Schon wieder Slapstick Champions League 😂 Gott dieser Sport ist so langweilig
M4aT7TNk4MA,Barcelona Femini always giving me goosebumps. A joy to watch all the time ❤
M4aT7TNk4MA,"Frankfurt started the game well,what happened??"
M4aT7TNk4MA,So painful to see assisat always on the bench
M4aT7TNk4MA,"wow, that referee is either very old or had a very tough life."
M4aT7TNk4MA,"The prospect of Keira Walsh giving encouragement in Manchester accented Catalan is a joy to behold .And,I mean that nicely"
M4aT7TNk4MA,Panos makes mistakes it's time for cata coll.
M4aT7TNk4MA,Freigang ist schon hot as fck 🥰😮‍💨
M4aT7TNk4MA,...it's like Barca took the best Spain  cup winning players n left the other ones for Real Madrid 😢
M4aT7TNk4MA,Women team so greatttt
M4aT7TNk4MA,"If some of  Eintracht Frankfurt fans had focused more on supporting their team than insulting Barcelona, their team could probably have won. 💙❤️"
M4aT7TNk4MA,"Barca should sign Nicole Anyoi, she was top class in this game"
M4aT7TNk4MA,Megan Rapinoe was the ref
M4aT7TNk4MA,I love watching this women they're so amazing what amazed me much is that real Madrid feminino are not match for them😂
M4aT7TNk4MA,Barca too strong
M4aT7TNk4MA,"Honestly, this barca can beat Rwanda 🇷🇼 men national team. Wow!"
M4aT7TNk4MA,Barca women plays extremely well thsb the men team......enjots watching them play all time
M4aT7TNk4MA,Best team ever
M4aT7TNk4MA,Barca’s win was inversely proportional to their away fan group. 😂😂😂
M4aT7TNk4MA,barça women play much better than the  men team.. I always watch their games.
54h-O1wtN30,bacha update lets go. Can't believe EAFC made me care about women football but here we are! Great Job!

GiA34TuMh5g,"What a steal from Bayern, their first gol was absolutely a shame, a mix of what it is not allowed on a football pitch hand touche first, offside then?! Is the ref blind?!"
GiA34TuMh5g,AS Roma needs to sign Efia Odo from Ghana 🇬🇭 to beef up their striking force....
GiA34TuMh5g,"Wow! So proud of Roma and especially the amazing Evelyne Viens! a tie away at Bayern, with a ref against you is a win in my book!❤"

t5qEoHyFNjM,Wolfsburg is playing well. Hopefully they win Champions League this year.
gamE6bkdVoE,"Hi guys, yet another great NWSL game. Thanks for bringing us this excellently competitive league. I just wonder if you can confirm if the final matchday game between Chicago and OL Reign is set in stone, or can a different game be shown if one or even both teams have been eliminated? Like Orlando or Angel City, or even Louisville, who are right on the margins. And will you be showing all the playoff games and the Final? Thank you and all the best."

-VMB2SiUrLg,Spain without carácter of Real Madrid academy never will win the World Cup !!!!!i don’t like compare with barca because every one know Negreiras boys are there helping always them !!  We need justice first to be everyone with same opportunities!!! Stop 🛑 Negreiras boys !!!!
-VMB2SiUrLg,"Dear DAZN, please tell me you are gonna live stream all the women's world cup matches. Pleaseeeeee"
-VMB2SiUrLg,what trophies have they won as real madrid players?
-VMB2SiUrLg,Really hope 100% pure original women not fake/modifying gender to be a women...if not it will against women's right
-VMB2SiUrLg,"Real Madrid should buy Alexia, Aitana, and some of Barça players if they want to win some titles.."
HuQ5F9Lmusg,I'm okay wiht the different language but we need a cc in english at least
HuQ5F9Lmusg,How much to subscribe to watch the game at Dazn every month?
HuQ5F9Lmusg,Can you upload with Subtitle pls? If it is not english
HuQ5F9Lmusg,Last year's euro changed everything.
HuQ5F9Lmusg,"History makers, record breakers and game changers."
HuQ5F9Lmusg,"Um, 'models' or 'role models'?  It has been great to see the meteoric rise in the womens' game... pay, standards, stars, crowds.

I hope the governing bodies can overcome their endemic corruption and advance the womens' game in nations so misogynistic that serious participation is almost zero."
HuQ5F9Lmusg,❤🤩can't wait!!
4G4Lp5Et66w,Here after the world cup. Thanks DAZN for sharing video of these world class players.

4G4Lp5Et66w,"Gotta work on these highlights, it's basically only goalscoring."
4G4Lp5Et66w,"It's a shame that patri Guijarro , Mapi Leon , Sandra Panos , and Claudia Pina won't be at the world cup because of the dispute they had with their coach and federation"
4G4Lp5Et66w,17 players from Barca will play WC that is most from one club.  Would have been 20+ if it wasn't for vilda
4G4Lp5Et66w,"Russo, Aitana, Bacha, Smith and some others. Putellas is great only for the Spanish League. She always disappears when needed in international games for Barcelona and for Spain. It happened before several times."
4G4Lp5Et66w,"Paredes, Alexia, Aitana and Mariona, and to a lesser extent Salma and the other young women from Spain are sold and worthless; They prefer to go to a World Cup faking something they don't believe in than to defend their ideals.


Up Mapi, Pina, Patri and those who have stood up to Vilda.
Vilda out! Visca el Barça!  💙❤"
4G4Lp5Et66w,"The best women club of football of the world.
 Visca Barça. 💙❤"
4G4Lp5Et66w,"Two times Hansen's assist versus Wolfsburg and no one time Hansen's goal against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge... FIX IT !!

Edit: It's a shame that Mapi and Patri can't be in the World Cup"
4G4Lp5Et66w,Sorry but Alexia has no relevance at this point. Aitana carried that midfield all the way to the UCL.
4G4Lp5Et66w,"will be closely watching all these wonderful players.  will be interesting to see how they do with their national teams.   especially interested in Norway,  so many great players.  CGH is a must watch."
4G4Lp5Et66w,only VARca in dazn?  agg

EwApQ9FSopE,"""STINA BLACKSTENIUS""
'Crucial Game Goal Scorer'
😱😱👌👌👍👍❤️❤️❤️"
EwApQ9FSopE,She's fantastic ❤
EwApQ9FSopE,"Does anyone else use subtitles and love how the caption writers make attempts on Blackstenius name. ""Black status, Black items, Black inside us, ***** just skips that line."" 😂"
EwApQ9FSopE,"now russo is in, arsenal's frontlines are massive even without beth and vivian"
EwApQ9FSopE,Stina is so underrated 🔥
EwApQ9FSopE,"She’s the beast.
Stina Beastenius 
Enjoy being a gunner Stina ❤️."
EwApQ9FSopE,"My striker😍👏,,a star player😊"
EwApQ9FSopE,"The other strikers seem to get most of the press, but Blackstenius deserves just as much recognition. She is one of the most consistent and hard working players in the world."
EwApQ9FSopE,SHE IS SUPER AWESOME
EwApQ9FSopE,"Stina putting on an AMAZONA like performance ,tenacious, industrious, coolheaded, played in every Arsenal's game last season and scoring important goals in WSL & UWCL❤🤍💪👍"
EwApQ9FSopE,She scores the goals… she scores the goals!
LVWYhVjoB-0,She's amaznig!
LVWYhVjoB-0,fantastic goalkeeper!!
LVWYhVjoB-0,I think Mala is one of the best female goalkeepers ❤
LVWYhVjoB-0,Had an amazing season it's a shame she ism the second or third Germany keeper for the world cup
LVWYhVjoB-0,Still can‘t believe that she‘s not in the German World Cup squad. What kind of videos did the German team manager watch?
LVWYhVjoB-0,from Germany
LVWYhVjoB-0,Probably the best now. She was the only reason they won against barca 3 1
LVWYhVjoB-0,She did not even make it to the top 4 german goalkeepers for WC 2023 😳
LVWYhVjoB-0,"She's kind of like David James - mostly brilliant, but prone to howlers."
cIrmxGfT7kg,"I just find it interesting how no one is addressing the very clearly deliberate choice of the channel to go with the _least_ traditionally 'Nordic' looking face of football for the thumbnail of this video! I mean, it's not like she's the best player of the region, so obviously their reasons must be... well, what?"
cIrmxGfT7kg,I would love for a nordic country to win the world cup this year!
cIrmxGfT7kg,"I would love DAZN to ask these players to speak in their native languages. Football is a global game yet the players from Iceland and Norway, etc speak English for this video? Come on, appeal to different groups of people - speak your native language!"
cIrmxGfT7kg,"Nice, but I miss F. Rolfö 😮."
cIrmxGfT7kg,"Such a brilliant episode. These phenomenal athletes are changing the game for every single footballer in every discipline and level. So many players like Sòcrates used their platform to create positive social change for everyone. There’s a fantastic quote by Eric Cantona who said “…football is not just about the game. It’s also about human values…”. Pèle was highly supportive of Marta in her fight for equality. The great Bill Shankly also lived by the principles of working together, for each other and sharing the rewards. Football belongs to the people and it’s for everyone to enjoy and play. Keep fighting for a better and equal world ✊🌎🌍🌏❤️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️👩‍🦽🧑‍🦽"
cIrmxGfT7kg,There's something happening here and I need to get involved. And I'm glad I'm involved 🎉❤
mp9RPTjYIeM,"Bayern were really exciting to watch. No doubt in my mind that they’ll be strong favourites to win the Champions League next season. Especially with the signings they’ve made, the support from the club and the fans."
RjYa3UcZf7k,😅😅😅😅😅  is this Football or Karate 😅😅😅😅
QtjlHiKWeCg,CLOE LACASSE should %100 be on this list.
QtjlHiKWeCg,forwards look amazing
QtjlHiKWeCg,"6:43 .. in that game he had lo say "" leonardson maanum "" every bloody time , was like a broken record"
QtjlHiKWeCg,2:30 .. should NEVER have been a penalty
QtjlHiKWeCg,4 Norwegians.....my dark horse  for the world cup
QtjlHiKWeCg,I am watching each of the videos that DAZN uploads.
QtjlHiKWeCg,This should also be broadcast on TV channels like Espn. Thank you DAZN for supporting women's football.
QtjlHiKWeCg,"You had me at :

*•Mala Grohs•*

*•Mapi Leon•*

*•Frida Maanum•* but ONLY because I thought she scored the best looking goal of the tournament

*•Aitana Bonmati•*

As for the other 7 players on the list, I could go 50/50 on them all."
QtjlHiKWeCg,Hey UEFA this is how you make a proper team of the season not that misinformed list of yours
QtjlHiKWeCg,"To the person reading this: Even though I don’t know you, I wish you the best of what life has to offer ❤"
HLdzbC0y3H4,"listen im never gonna be convinced that was a goal line clearance from kumagai. Like dont get me wrong shes amazing however from the amount of angles Ive watched it, and the amount of times ive seen it, i think it goes over the line. We'll never know cause teams get to pick and choose whether or not they have goal line tech (should be mandatory in the knockout stages IMO) but no the less I think it was a goal."
HLdzbC0y3H4,Magnifying ❤💯💯women's soccer
HLdzbC0y3H4,At 0:33 the bayern playern need to have minimum a yellow card or red due to the kick .No goal situation.Beautiful goal/pass in this video.Amazing girls🎉
HLdzbC0y3H4,Rolfo really is the Roberto Carlos of women football
HLdzbC0y3H4,"No.3  ONE TOUCH PLAY...Maanum intercepts...diagonal pass to Lia Walti...Blackstenius sends it to...Williamson, flicks to Maanum..strike and a GOAL. The ball starts with Maanum and Maanum finishes the play as well.👍❤🤍🙏"
HLdzbC0y3H4,"Thank you for this collection. Only a few years ago the feature would have been ""Worst women's mistakes"" or ""Top women's goalkeeping fails."" Look how far this league has come in such a short time! I think history will judge this an amazing period in the development of the game."
HLdzbC0y3H4,"one of the best reaction saves ive seen (grohs, obviously)"
HLdzbC0y3H4,We have Not Matsch fanc
HLdzbC0y3H4,Berger dance is an instant classic
HLdzbC0y3H4,"First off, I have to say that no list like this could even be considered legit without at least one play/clip featuring Japan’s/Bayern Munich absolutely sublime defensive footballer, *Saki Kumagai.* Secondarily, the same can be said about Scotland/Real Madrid attacking midfielder/forward, *Caroline Weir.* Quite simply the (very) best player at her position, in the entire world. IMHO, of course."
HLdzbC0y3H4,"Scoring a brace in Ucl finals, just zidane levels"
HLdzbC0y3H4,"0:10  What a save. 0:56  Not sure what Liverpool and Man City were thinking when they let Weir walk away, absolute superstar. 2:49  Bonmati’s piece of magic to set up Rolfo. 3:55  Leah Williamson setting up Manuum’s wonder strike. Leah is one of the most technically gifted players on the planet. 4:32 The build up play and Pina’s screamer was absolutely stunning. 5:07 Barcelona playing football like the 1982 Seleção."
HLdzbC0y3H4,"To the person reading this: Even though I don’t know you, I wish you the best of what life has to offer ❤"

E7U77hDOkno,The sheer amount of worldies that come from Women's Football is amazing.
E7U77hDOkno,Oshoala goal is the best
E7U77hDOkno,I'm waiting for CGH goals.

E7U77hDOkno,CGH Stamford Bridge screamer isn't even top ten?
E7U77hDOkno,Where Ewa Pajor goals ????
E7U77hDOkno,Oshoala's goal is the best
E7U77hDOkno,Rolfo and Manuum’s goals were the best. That back heel by Bonmati was a work of art. The build up play to set up Manuum’s goal was stunning.
E7U77hDOkno,Love the near post goal by rolfo. A rocket. No chance

98KuGxhJfls,Barcelona showed their character and strength when needed. Deserve the title absolutely! Congratulations 😄
98KuGxhJfls,"Femeni dominated game play all match -- 4 mistakes in the first half cost them. 2 defensive mistakes that Wolfsburg capitalized on in spectacular fashion, and 2 offensive mistakes that should have had Femeni 2-2 at the half, possibly 3-2. Second half was all Femeni. Great comeback!!

CAMPIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

q8_l9OShHLg,Why was it played in day time?
q8_l9OShHLg,why was putellas on the bench? isnt she the goat of womens football
q8_l9OShHLg,"That final goal shows you why women’s soccer still has a way to go. Just as the commentator noted…”a catalog of errors”. 
Bonmati world class. Need more players like her. Almost there. Just need one more generation to compile enough talent to field 2 squads of world-class talent. Demand for women’s soccer clearly here…need the supply."

q8_l9OShHLg,🏆Barça Femeni🏆 Champions of Champions.💙❤️💙❤️💙❤️
q8_l9OShHLg,How can I watch Barça Women for free
q8_l9OShHLg,6:38 Darwin Nunez would've 100% missed that
q8_l9OShHLg,02:36 nobody is gonna talk about that popp fault
q8_l9OShHLg,This is so funny btw
q8_l9OShHLg,I confused why people spend money&time watch this
q8_l9OShHLg,That second goal from Barcelona shouldn’t  have been valid tbh
q8_l9OShHLg,"One of the best champions league finals I ever watch... My culers play with their hearts, love those ladies ❤"
q8_l9OShHLg,"Women football lol, what a joke"
q8_l9OShHLg,lucy should pass to paredes and paredes to guijarro
q8_l9OShHLg,"What a final, what a comeback. From 2-0 down to win 3-2 in stunning fashion. The football they played in that second half was unreal. The Barcelona fans were electric. Congratulations Barcelona on winning their second UWCL and their seventh UCL title OVERALL. Barcelona did so in the one of the homes of their former legendary manager Sir Bobby Robson. Barcelona are now equal with AC Milan in joint third in the OVERALL UCL table. Lyon are second with eight, Real Madrid are first with fourteen. 🏆 🔵🔴"
q8_l9OShHLg,The fact that i know almost all the players tanks to FC24 is great for womens football! :)
q8_l9OShHLg,They play better than mens
q8_l9OShHLg,women's football has very high quality in club but in national team it is just so bad i wonder why
q8_l9OShHLg,Never mess with Barcelona
q8_l9OShHLg,This second goal always make me cry man. So sweet and unbelievable. I love this club so much❤️💙
q8_l9OShHLg,lol they literally played that song at end of world cup games too.. 1 playlist fifa?
q8_l9OShHLg,I love my Ladies once again up Barcelona
q8_l9OShHLg,0:47 Bronze making mistakes here & in the World Cup only difference she was on the opposite team during the World Cup
q8_l9OShHLg,and now champions of world
q8_l9OShHLg,6:36 is enough
q8_l9OShHLg,"Here after Spain won the WWC and it means that Putellas now have UWCL, Ballon D'or feminin, and WWC🔥🐐"
q8_l9OShHLg,That first fumble by Barcelona was absolutely  horrible and no ones talking about it. In a champions league final as well. Its crazy she didn't get subbed off.
q8_l9OShHLg,Love Barca team!
q8_l9OShHLg,"Fridolina Rolfö comes from western Sweden close to great Väner lake. Vandals came from this area and S E Norway. The vandals first known name was VendilaR. Vänerns name was Vaenir(10th c.-*VendiR(until 8th c)-*Vendiz(around 0 A. D.). That means probably 'The turner', ""The tide and floodlake"". Rebecka Blomqvist and Natalie Hagman also have roots here.. You can say that the final was decided by someone with vandal connections.. VendilaR means probably ""the lesser people from Väner lake's cultunion.."""
q8_l9OShHLg,Best comeback ever
q8_l9OShHLg,14th July and still watching this🎉🎉🎉❤
q8_l9OShHLg,At least their women know how to win

q8_l9OShHLg,Hi watching download this
q8_l9OShHLg,"Thanks DAZN chanal🙏🏼
VISCA BARÇA 💪💙❤"
q8_l9OShHLg,5:14 Gave me goosebumps. The celebration of the crowd.
q8_l9OShHLg,And they claim to deserve the same payment as the men’s team. This is Sunday league level. 7:07
q8_l9OShHLg,too bad the underdog didnt win
q8_l9OShHLg,At least this Barca didn’t get grouped
q8_l9OShHLg,"LGBT on your profil picture, so bad."
q8_l9OShHLg,better than man's one 🤣
q8_l9OShHLg,Love from Bangladesh ❤❤❤
q8_l9OShHLg,Bro the 1. and the last goal 💀💀💀What are they doing

q8_l9OShHLg,"The Wolfsburg's goalkeeper, what a player!!"
q8_l9OShHLg,"Men soccer, women soccer - one is a sport, one is a joke. I love sports, I love jokes. 
Room for all"
q8_l9OShHLg,8:19. What the heck were the male staff doing on the podium?? 😮 Let only the players and the coach have their moment. Shameful act.
q8_l9OShHLg,The way that third goal was scored was unbecoming of a CL final. 😮
q8_l9OShHLg,"Best highlights in the World, thanks DAZN!"
q8_l9OShHLg,"Sorry, but women’s football is boring! It’s like watching a bunch of clueless teenage boys having a knock about in a park on a Sunday afternoon. They should stick to female stereotypical sports like KNITTING!!!….."
q8_l9OShHLg,Epic Comeback
q8_l9OShHLg,These Women play better than Chelsea. 😢😢😢
q8_l9OShHLg,Without messi bercelona is not important

q8_l9OShHLg,"What a comeback,🔥🔥"
q8_l9OShHLg,Wolf number 9 dog
q8_l9OShHLg,"Eva Pajor. Hero and Villain,"
q8_l9OShHLg,6:37 how did she fail to shoot the ball
q8_l9OShHLg,The defense on that last goal was atrociously bad --  12 year old rec-league level stuff.
q8_l9OShHLg,Ewa Pajor is Polish women version of Robert Lewandowski😊
q8_l9OShHLg,Women's football is so funny.
q8_l9OShHLg,The last goal summarizes women's football 😅
q8_l9OShHLg,the Third goal only happens in women football 🙂

q8_l9OShHLg,Give them all a vacuüm cleaner as a trophy
q8_l9OShHLg,This is funny
q8_l9OShHLg,"It’s not so much that Barca won through superior play, but more of Wolfsburg losing the plot with 2 goals on hand. How do you leave an attacking midfielder like Patri unmarked? Not once, but twice. And that third goal by Barca was a comedy of errors by Wolfsburg. Rolfo’s like, “thank you very much” 🎁 🥅 ⚽️ 🏆"
q8_l9OShHLg,"Striker for wbg couldve passed to others for a goal,its a team game,so they paid the price of being a gut’s!"
q8_l9OShHLg,"Anyone here supporting woman's Barcelona for Messi?🙋
Or only me😂"
q8_l9OShHLg,"Well played Wolfsburg 💪

q8_l9OShHLg,"This Barcelona women can beat Chelsea men in Stanford Bridge, home and away."
q8_l9OShHLg,3rd goal was really funny for Barcelona
q8_l9OShHLg,ITs hurts to lose in the way the Wolfsburg women after leading 2-0 they end up losing 2-3 so sad  anyway Congratulations to Barcelona🥇✨ though i wanted Wolfsburg to win
q8_l9OShHLg,Wow!.. so brest womens playfootball😊❤❤

q8_l9OShHLg,German teams seems to love bottling their final game... 🤣
q8_l9OShHLg,They had us in the first half not gonna lie 😂
q8_l9OShHLg,You gotta love that shoulder goal. So technically sound
q8_l9OShHLg,Women should play futbol 11 on a 8 vs 8 pitch
q8_l9OShHLg,Congratulations barcelona female
q8_l9OShHLg,Couldn't even get through the whole highlight
q8_l9OShHLg,Visca el Barca! What a comeback. Barcelona Womens team are slowly becoming the 'prime barca' of this era.
q8_l9OShHLg,Visca Barca love you forever from Bali❤️❤️❤️❤️
q8_l9OShHLg,Meanwhile the WNBA do not even get 10% of this  packed stadium.
q8_l9OShHLg,This was so much more interesting than any mens champions league final in history
q8_l9OShHLg,I was so rooting for Wolfsburg. Too bad they couldn't hold on. This Barca team is incredibly. What a hars forth comeback. Congratulations to the ladies.
q8_l9OShHLg,A game of two halfs
q8_l9OShHLg,"Wolfsburg's #10 Huth might just have the worst midfielder defensive awareness I have ever seen.  She might be a #10, but her poor positining contributed to all 3 Barca goals.  Astoundingly poor."
q8_l9OShHLg,Both of you are great 🙌👏👏
q8_l9OShHLg,What a come back 🙄🙄
q8_l9OShHLg,Does anyone actually watch this lol? 😂
q8_l9OShHLg,"what a comeback, vamos barca"
q8_l9OShHLg,Congratulations 👏🎉🎉🎉👏👏
q8_l9OShHLg,This was so boring I couldn't even finish the highlights 😂
q8_l9OShHLg,"Barca Femme deserved for thr Champions, congrats girls ❤🎉"
q8_l9OShHLg,The men would have given up after the got scored on 2 times. The feminine team poured all of their soul and energy into never giving up.
q8_l9OShHLg,"Next season FC Barcelona women will meet FC Bayern women, can barca revenge 2-8 on women squad? Let we see next season. 😄😄😄"
q8_l9OShHLg,United mens not even half of these qualities...
q8_l9OShHLg,CAMPEONAS
q8_l9OShHLg,Great game from both sides!
q8_l9OShHLg,"This is not football, is just a kind of stand up comedy. Oltragious"
q8_l9OShHLg,💙❤️ amazing match both teams 💚💚
q8_l9OShHLg,"Great character from Barcelona. What a comeback! Congrats to Barca. Top notch finals. Well tried Wolfsburg. Respect. You showed more fight and grit than many expected, and made a right match of it. When a game is this evenly matched, the team that makes less mistakes is the team that wins."
q8_l9OShHLg,Women barca is the better one
q8_l9OShHLg,Barca goal is ordinary dan they lucky...
q8_l9OShHLg,Aitana Goatmati for Ballon d'or 🥳
q8_l9OShHLg,Incredible match! Congrats to Barcelona! What a comeback!
q8_l9OShHLg,Congratulations Girls ❤💙
q8_l9OShHLg,"6:37 ladies and be gentlemen is what I call the “Harry Maguire Sequence” ,which is self explanatory in itself ."
q8_l9OShHLg,Hope transgender people don't step foot in women's football
q8_l9OShHLg,my favourite part was when popp pulled mapis shirt and tripped her so hard she fell and then scored 😀😀
q8_l9OShHLg,CONGRATULATIONS 
q8_l9OShHLg,Barça and comebacks
q8_l9OShHLg,Womens Football it's a place for LGBT🤣🤣🤣
q8_l9OShHLg,"4:40 That first goal by Barca was unique. They played on the minds of Wolfsburg's defence and did a Barca classic.
They just couldn't have seen it coming"
q8_l9OShHLg,"It's ironic how, Wolfsburg thought at half time, they had won it over Barca. 
Very well forgetting that with Barca, it is not over until it is over.
The Barca Mentality"
q8_l9OShHLg,Can't stop laughing at the 3rd goal 😂😂
q8_l9OShHLg,Barca is sporting organisation
q8_l9OShHLg,That 3rd barca goal just shows the gulf in quality between men's and women's football.
q8_l9OShHLg,will can do this again
q8_l9OShHLg,"Let's be honest,  we don't search for this😅"
q8_l9OShHLg,what a game!
q8_l9OShHLg,"Latin Power Baby ¡¡¡¡ => 
World Cup=Argentina , Champions League=Sevilla ,  UEFA Women's Champions League 2023=Barcelona ¡¡ 
Manchester City Vs Inter => Inter = Winner ????"
q8_l9OShHLg,"As a neutral, what i notice is that the gap is shrinking btw barca and other top clubs"
q8_l9OShHLg,"Wolfsburg parked the bus + counters in the first half and it worked for them; but they parked the bus 5 minutes too late in the second half and the 2-2 happened (that said, Graham-Hansen virtually created the first goal). Ironic that Rolfö was the one to score the final 3-2."
q8_l9OShHLg,Sunday park football🙃
q8_l9OShHLg,6:34 if you wanna know why women's soccer will never be popular
q8_l9OShHLg,why did Putellas not start in the 1st eleven?

q8_l9OShHLg,We womens in the edit come back to win ❤❤🎉
q8_l9OShHLg,6:34 Harry Maguire is proud of her

q8_l9OShHLg,Wolfsburg #9 cost them. Selfish player!
q8_l9OShHLg,"Hilarious, just hilarious."
q8_l9OShHLg,"Barcelona 1st shot on goal 45min, 2nd shot on goal 47min, 3rd shot on goal 49min. And finally win, spent entire first half believing in tiki taka and forgot to actually play, second half they  woke up"
q8_l9OShHLg,I hope Spain can sort out the mess with Vilda so that their best players will be at the World Cup.
q8_l9OShHLg,What was that winning goal 💀
q8_l9OShHLg,Wolsburg more deserved the champions than barca😢

There is no way that Barca should have won  if not for that lame defense of Wolfsburg"
q8_l9OShHLg,What an epic comeback..😱🔥🔥
q8_l9OShHLg,This is more boring than my local U14 boys match.
q8_l9OShHLg,"Barca's 3rd, that is absolutely EMBARASSING defending! but Lucy Bronze is without doubt one of the best full backs to play the game and the best full back to come out of England!"
q8_l9OShHLg,That 3rd goal💀
q8_l9OShHLg,"Pathetic defending by both teams throughout the match. Wolfsburg very strong and efficient in attack in the first, Barcelona equally so in the second. But the attacking display of Barca in the first half was the most embarrassing part of the whole match. Give massive chances like that to 14 year olds, boys or girls, and they put them away nine out of ten times. Not a boring match, but the fact that the least bad team won, instead of the best...this final was really negative PR for women's football. And that's a shame."

q8_l9OShHLg,"Big congrats to Barcelona for this amazing comeback. It's definitely not over until it's over. My late dad would always say: ""It's only a dead person who says I have tried, but you keep trying while alive"". Barcelona never gave up and kept pushing on, but Wolfsburg relaxed and went to sleep. The outcome is Barcelona champions of the day. 

Wolfsburg coach and players will surely have nightmares for weeks knowing they had it 50% but lost it at full 100% because they celebrated before the war was over. 

But I didn't see Nigeria's Azizat (Barcelona player) in the highlight game. What happened to her?"
q8_l9OShHLg,"Beautiful game, both team is exceptional. 1st half wolf winning. And everyone probably thought its over. But then 2nd half Barca femeni came back from 0-2 wow mind blowing! 3-2 congratulations barcelona femeni 🎉🎉"
q8_l9OShHLg,Wolfsburg's defending in the area was terrible today. They looked confused and slow to react.

SF0j1YT4Vq0,"Fridolina Rolfö comes from western Sweden close to great Väner lake. Vandals came probably from this area and S E Norway. You can see on bronze-age carvings that the culture was the same..The vandals first known name was VendilaR. Vänerns name was Vaenir(10th c.-*VendiR(until 8th c)-*Vendiz(around 0 A. D.). That means probably 'The turner', ""The tide and floodlake"". Rebecka Blomqvist and Natalie Hagman also have roots here.. You can say that the final was decided by someone with vandal connections.. VendilaR means probably ""the lesser people from Väner lake's cultunion.."""
SF0j1YT4Vq0,"Wolfsburg congratulation you did amazing game, Visca Barça"
dkfXiuA-RzU,Gut so!
dkfXiuA-RzU,"Best women final ive ever seen, both team are outstanding, Heads up Wolfs you did well, however Barcelona was just superior and you tried everything. Well deserve win for Barcelona coming back from 0-2 to 3-2 Barcelona had to show to the world that they are the best womens team at the moment."
dkfXiuA-RzU,"Love this club.
FCBARCELONA 4LIFE 💪💙❤"
dkfXiuA-RzU,Alexia Putellas and Messi Win Ballon d'Or 2023  !!! VISCA BARCA
dkfXiuA-RzU,Bs team investigate them

dkfXiuA-RzU,Horse-racing with donkeys
dkfXiuA-RzU,What a comeback!
dkfXiuA-RzU,"Third Barca goal, such a gift. Bottled it badly. 😖"
dkfXiuA-RzU,Das dritte tor was ist das?
dkfXiuA-RzU,that was a crazy comeback girls you deserve it visca barca🏆🏆🔵🔴
dkfXiuA-RzU,Not a single black player on the pitch
dkfXiuA-RzU,No one is talking about the gurl with number 12 she’s so amazing 🔥

dkfXiuA-RzU,"superb game , can't wait for the world cup"
dkfXiuA-RzU,What a REMONTADA!! So proud of our girls 💪 VISCA BARCA 💙❤️
dkfXiuA-RzU,When the women's team has more balls than the men's team.
dkfXiuA-RzU,How many trans there are playing ??? 😂😂😂
dkfXiuA-RzU,"Wolfsburg needs a new 4 line of center backs that could manage games like this, besides taking out Roord out of the pitch was a bad movement, cuz she gives you calm and keep the ball close her feet… the worse thing was the lack of reaction and letting Brand and Waßmuth in the bench since the start when they’re better than some of the 11 starter."
dkfXiuA-RzU,I like the mentality of the Barca women's team. That's so motivational and courageous. They are well deserved champions. Visca el barca❤️💙.. forever.
dkfXiuA-RzU,That third barca goal 🔥🔥🔥🔥
dkfXiuA-RzU,magic five.
dkfXiuA-RzU,Barcelona could have easily turned it around in the first half if they were sharper. They dominated from start to finish and are rightful winners.
dkfXiuA-RzU,What a beautiful football stadium ❤️
dkfXiuA-RzU,Reporterin..Total unsympathische Stimme..iiii
dkfXiuA-RzU,"Barcelona champion of the Women's Champions League!

They fell 0-2 against Wolfsburg but ended up taking it 3-2.

🏆Second title in the competition for the Catalans, second title in the competition for Spain."
dkfXiuA-RzU,3:2 goal is women football in a nutshell hahahahah

dkfXiuA-RzU,What a comeback? 2mn two goals visca barça y visca cataluña
dkfXiuA-RzU,Wolfburg did not help their central defence
dkfXiuA-RzU,They were better all game. Just two errors that led to two goals
dkfXiuA-RzU,Notable favoritism from the commentators. They were clearly in favor of Wolfsburg.
dkfXiuA-RzU,The best team in the world Vaamooz Barcelona ❤
dkfXiuA-RzU,Barca feminine greatest ever 🎉
dkfXiuA-RzU,I hope that Barcelona's men team learn from this on how to come back in a match when you're 2 goals down

9wuO5g3pURc,Hilarious champion league final😂
9wuO5g3pURc,FC Barçalona is the best club in the world ❤💙
9wuO5g3pURc,The game where Maguire found true love 💕
9wuO5g3pURc,Maguire really set that no-look defending a trend
9wuO5g3pURc,POV: you signed Harry maguire
9wuO5g3pURc,Why is everybody doing the stanky leg? 🤣
9wuO5g3pURc,"They need to show more of these women's soccer highlights! It's like a walking blooper real, all they need to do is brand it as a comedy and viewership will skyrocket, then they can get equal pay"
9wuO5g3pURc,what is this?
9wuO5g3pURc,wow. women really cant play football
9wuO5g3pURc,Match fixing 😅
9wuO5g3pURc,"The most disgusting goal ever 🤣🤣🤣🤣 , she shot her face 🤣🤣"
9wuO5g3pURc,sunday league level that
9wuO5g3pURc,What is this LOL
9wuO5g3pURc,"It seems people forget Karius at the finals, plus this final 3-2 was more interesting than 1-0"
9wuO5g3pURc,I honestly laughed watching that sequence
9wuO5g3pURc,now i can see why 15 year olds can beat women futball players
9wuO5g3pURc,"I feel like women put the stereotype to there football from there actions, if her head hold up forward why she kick the ball on her TM"
9wuO5g3pURc,Watch real football
9wuO5g3pURc,What did I see from the woman champions league
9wuO5g3pURc,Watching women play football is like watching babies trying to walk.
9wuO5g3pURc,That might be the jammiest goal I’ve ever seen 😂😂
9wuO5g3pURc,They look like they have no idea what they're doing 😂
9wuO5g3pURc,Amazing comeback 🎉🎉
9wuO5g3pURc,Maguire every where😂😂😂
9wuO5g3pURc,This is so embarrassing defending
9wuO5g3pURc,Mariona the worst barca player on the field
9wuO5g3pURc,Congrats to Barcelona ❤

R9o4rR7UmCU,"Not fair they allow a Carol clone to play on the pitch. Carol nutmegs, teleports, receive her own pass and make an assist 😂 like ok slow down, what just happened. The best thing about this play is Aitana already casually walking back to center circle as Carol makes a pass to herself seeing into the future i'm done here, it's going to be a goal."
R9o4rR7UmCU,Women's soccer improve a little
R9o4rR7UmCU,"great move to put this content out for free, it will grow"
R9o4rR7UmCU,We need Graham Hanson at man utd.We want Qatari ownership
R9o4rR7UmCU,That was an amazing game. Better final than the men’s Champions League.
R9o4rR7UmCU,That was brilliant.  Now they need to beat u16 boys team.
R9o4rR7UmCU,"Underrated play by Bonmati to leave the ball when Graham Hanson was dribbling. Had she even motioned to the ball, the whole play would have been called off for offside."
R9o4rR7UmCU,Kiera Walsh confused the defenders
R9o4rR7UmCU,No wonder if you shoot at your own teammates
R9o4rR7UmCU,Thanks barca
R9o4rR7UmCU,Now 3 : 2 at 79:00
35h2mbC87UE,"Hey, Jill Roord, you don’t have to be so classless and tactless as to throw Rome under the bus by saying, “the pitch was really bad.” Sorry that some countries have only “bad pitches” to offer you, your majesty. A player with some class would say, “the pitch was a difficult one to play on.” How would you like for people to say that you look like The Joker (because of your big mouth,) instead of, “ Jill has a big smile.”"

w_J0tkPRrNk,"🇿🇲 🇿🇲 🇿🇲 🇿🇲 🇿🇲 🇿🇲 Zambian made 🎉

Go make your mark on the World Stage.  Japan Costa Rica &  Spain are waiting..."
w_J0tkPRrNk,Nice one racheal
w_J0tkPRrNk,"Well done Madrid CFF, thumbs to Rachael Kundanaji"
w_J0tkPRrNk,She one of the best my beloved sister 💕💕
w_J0tkPRrNk,"Racheal Kundanaji African Best Forward 2023 She Come From Zambia
Copper Queens Watch Her In The Coming World Cup2023."
w_J0tkPRrNk,"Pourquoi capitaine match sont bloqué dans mon pays le senegal

 Why the match is blocked in my country senegal"
w_J0tkPRrNk,"Liga F is a joke, there is no way a team can win a league competition getting 85 points out of 90
They need to cut the number of teams to 12 to improve quality"
w_J0tkPRrNk,"Barcelona is still great, but it was cool to see an underdog team be the ones to end a streak."
w_J0tkPRrNk,"8:17 That's a blatant foul on Barcelona player. There should be no goal for Madrid, but free kick for Barcelona."
w_J0tkPRrNk,"Barcelona must be signed Ichika Egashira from Excursionistas , Argentina ."
w_J0tkPRrNk,"Pathetic game. At this rate, wolfsburg will thrash us."
w_J0tkPRrNk,23 months of unbeaten run and finally to get beaten by two goals from the same player. An African. This with Alexia also in the team. wow
w_J0tkPRrNk,Talk about bad timing... A draw and a loss just before UWCL final... But I know they'll bounce back !! Força Barça ♥️💙
w_J0tkPRrNk,Ghosts are back. Wolfsburg will kick you
w_J0tkPRrNk,Not to take credit away from Madrid CFF but I'll never understand why they have the party bus parade while the season is still going on. The men's team also lost because of this. And Barca Femeni still have things to play for with CL final coming up. Have the parade when all the games have finished
w_J0tkPRrNk,"Extending your unbeaten run is a lower priority than CL title. Gather yourselves, Barca. Let's GO!"
w_J0tkPRrNk,"complacent attitude !! they just thought they would win as usual...their whole game lacked any spark...as a Barca fan, i'm glad they lost, MCFF deserved their win..time to face reality...Oshola, Salma, Geyse, Lopez are NOT top flight goal scorers.......geyse refuses to pass, lopez is all over the place, salma buzzes around like a bee but with little effect, and Oshoala just stands rigid waiting for the ball to come to her......barca should have quickly snagged Katoto and diani from psg before they re-signed again for psg"
w_J0tkPRrNk,THERE'S ALWAYS A TIME COMES WHEN SOMEONE COMES ALONG AND BEATS YOU
w_J0tkPRrNk,Barca picked the worst possible time to be in poor form. Wolfsburg are gonna be a real challenge in the UWCL final

CxbFu9EQbNk,"No players from Chelsea? Carter and Reiten played very well, they should be in the team."
CxbFu9EQbNk,Patri instead of walti
CxbFu9EQbNk,"I'm no Chelsea supporter, but you're not telling me that not even a single one of their players deserved to appear in the team of the semi-finals. I actually support Man United, but the amount of antipathy towards Chelsea is quite astounding. I mean, Guru Reiten scored an equaliser in the second leg against Barca and was really excellent, but she is entirely omitted. That's just for a start. 

There are some players on this list who made significant mistakes over the course of the two legs, so that can't be the reason why not one Chelsea player is included. Arsenal did not go through, just like Chelsea, but they have 3 players on the list, so that can't be the reason either. Did you just forget about Chelsea? It's not like every player performed terribly over 2 legs for them, so they don't deserve a spot. I don't like unfairness and I think there should at least have been one Chelsea player in this list. At the end of the day they made it all the way to the semi-final and it was not exactly an easy set of games for Barcelona in the end, but here it is like they have been written out of the history of this season. Disappointing. 

If Man U make it through to Europe and the group stages next year (fingers crossed), I hope they are treated with more respect."
CxbFu9EQbNk,"Perfect 11 🔥 also funny that from 4 semi-finalists, you chose not to pick from Chelsea"
CxbFu9EQbNk,Beattie made a couple of serious mistakes against Wolfsburg. So I wouldn't put her in there
CxbFu9EQbNk,"patri is so underrated, she should definitely get more recognition"
CxbFu9EQbNk,seeing aitana play is such a joy
CxbFu9EQbNk,the key for the final is.. Maria Leon.. she is the most important player in the defense of Barça.

JJ_jw7b6JJQ,Aitana Goatmati best player in the world right now
JJ_jw7b6JJQ,"The problem with any of these 'Top X' lists is, they always make you think of that thing which _isn't_ on it.

For me the missing one here is that ridiculous end-to-end run by Sveindís (which made the German commentator go ""Jónsdóttir"" a total of _seven_ times in a row!), with 2-3 defenders on her the whole way and she still got her shot at goal, and on target!! 👏👍"
JJ_jw7b6JJQ,Best play was Jonsdottirs run in the second leg.

i6pWMu8GOTI,4:39 that goal look like Drogba goal in final ucl Againt Munchen 😶
i6pWMu8GOTI,The ladies game needs to grow naturally and without the narrative that some want to push/attach to it. Stop the comparisons to the men’s game and enjoy the level at which it’s at. You are allowed to enjoy both!!
i6pWMu8GOTI,"Arsenal and european trophies are enemies, it not in the DNA of Arsenal to win european trophies.."
i6pWMu8GOTI,Lena come to Bayern ❤️🤍❤️
i6pWMu8GOTI,5:49 Brechstange in action?
i6pWMu8GOTI,"5:44 what a goal celebration, she absolutely trucks that Wolfsburg defender after scoring!"
i6pWMu8GOTI,Where is Lana Rhoades?
i6pWMu8GOTI,Fair win for Wolfsburg arsenal played rlly not bad but in the first game the 2:2 wasn't fair because one arsenal lady don't get red for a real red card and thats Feeling like Arsenal bought the ref because the ref had 5 false times in so normal Situations and i thounk arsenal bought the ref but the back game was excited and Arsenal played fair and in the end it was a rlly excited half final of the women Champions-League
i6pWMu8GOTI,"Hey !!! Dear coaches and managers !!! 

Please forget about everything they show you in UEFA Pro Licence courses and stop asking your goalkeepers to make short passes to the teammates on the sides. Just kick that bloody ball long please when you are under pressure and outnumbered by the opponents 😎👍"
i6pWMu8GOTI,Again VAR kills us ..same as to The Boys in the EPL...
i6pWMu8GOTI,"Gooner bottled again 🤣 
Well played Wolfsburg 💪"
i6pWMu8GOTI,Playing out from the back at 118 minutes is naive in the extreme.
i6pWMu8GOTI,A rampart Barcelona women's side.. I hope Wolfsburg women win the UCL
i6pWMu8GOTI,Arsenal man or woman teams . Doesn't matter 😂.  They always in the end losing 😂
i6pWMu8GOTI,I love that woman’s soccer is getting more attention.
i6pWMu8GOTI,"It’s crazy that I was actually thinking about the aftermath of the same move after the Wolfsburg player recovered the ball when it hit the crossbar at 115’, only for it to happen 3mns later 😂"
i6pWMu8GOTI,What an absolute gift we gave them
i6pWMu8GOTI,no.23 of wolfsburg is cute
i6pWMu8GOTI,Men’s football in slow motion 😀
i6pWMu8GOTI,It's seems women football players have better shooting accuracy than their men counterparts this days
i6pWMu8GOTI,An error lead to vfl wolfsburg victory however both team deserve to be in The Final 😊😊
i6pWMu8GOTI,"what an amazing match ,congratulations for both  teams, wondeful."
i6pWMu8GOTI,"Well done the Shewolves.  That was one of the best games ever. They did the record crowd proud. Can’t wait for next season, come on Arsenal!"
i6pWMu8GOTI,arsenal repeated same mistake they did on frst game
i6pWMu8GOTI,What a game!
i6pWMu8GOTI,Wolfsburg player to avoid the floor challenge (Impossible)
i6pWMu8GOTI,Arsenal football club is cursed..bottled jobs
i6pWMu8GOTI,FINAAAAALE 💚
i6pWMu8GOTI,No allegiance to either team but that was great to watch!!
i6pWMu8GOTI,That's going to hurt Arsenal ladies for a while.....critical error and they got punished. All the best Wolfsburg against the mighty Barcelona!
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Yo England, has it come home yet? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
9Loh1C-GRHs,LOL @1:44 you can see blackstenius offside further ahead of Woldsburg #6 but hey she got away with it here. @6:56 Jen Beattie totally just runs over the Wolfsburg player couldnt see # but hilarious. Well earned win by Wolfsburg unfortunately it's clear Arsenal suppose star power didn't show up to the game. LOL

9Loh1C-GRHs,Great going
9Loh1C-GRHs,The female cımmentator needs to put her teeth in.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Women football pretty popular
9Loh1C-GRHs,"The last goal, so Sunday league."
9Loh1C-GRHs,The arsenal girls have more balls than the men's team
9Loh1C-GRHs,Who is the co-commentating woman?
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal doing Arsenal things. Giving a cheap goal at the most crucial time. Same mistakes that the mens team does
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Imagine repeating same mistake against same opponent in 2 legs. Like you don't have the players to play from the back bro, kick the goal kick up and let everyone move."
9Loh1C-GRHs,Bottle jobs. Just like the men.
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Arsenal men/women seem cursed. They start strong, get our hope high sky and then let us on free fall without anything to hold on to."
9Loh1C-GRHs,not one English womens player in that arsenal team. got what they deserved😂
9Loh1C-GRHs,What happened to Huth😵‍💫
9Loh1C-GRHs,I really have to give Credit to both teams. Such high intensity from both teams especially Arsenal. They fought so hard although they made some little error in defending
9Loh1C-GRHs,voice of female commentator like Louis Armstrong https://youtu.be/VqhCQZaH4Vs?t=32
9Loh1C-GRHs,What a craze game 👏
9Loh1C-GRHs,Revenge of Uero  England Vs Germany final 😂
9Loh1C-GRHs,Sometimes you just have to hit the ref
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal is used to bottling up
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal gave away two goals bc of defense mistakes in both games. Sad.
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Color commentator knows only one adjective — ""brilliant"" -- and only one adverb -- ""absolutely."" Listening to the whole match was painful."
9Loh1C-GRHs,Wolfsburg were clearly the better side
9Loh1C-GRHs,"That was a clear pen for wolfsburg, the incompetent ref bottled a clear intentional handball😮"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Post match celebration:

https://youtu.be/MAcSv6kXJRg"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Would have liked to see McCabe's ball  hitting the post in the highlights too, could have been such a beautiful goal"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Hey !!! Dear coaches and managers !!! 

Please forget about everything they show you in UEFA Pro Licence courses and stop asking your goalkeepers to make short passes to the teammates on the sides. Just kick that bloody ball long please when you are under pressure and outnumbered by the opponents 😎👍"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Classic arsenal to make a mistake at the back all by themselves to throw the game away
9Loh1C-GRHs,"What a bad defending ,  Wihtout Leah this defence is nothing"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Germans beating the English! Love it!
9Loh1C-GRHs,right  back must pay for her sins
9Loh1C-GRHs,Bottles😂 just like the mens 😂
9Loh1C-GRHs,pressing in extra time won this - the belief from Wolsburg!
9Loh1C-GRHs,Valiant effort from Arsenal ❤️ really proud of how they fought till the v end with the number of injuries they have!!
9Loh1C-GRHs,Still no idea why those goals were ruled out as offside
9Loh1C-GRHs,Was at this game. The stadium was completely packed and the crowd was electric !
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal women wet their knickers 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Taking Blacksteinus off was not a great decision imo. She was speedy, on her game and always going for it. Did she pick up an injury we don't know about?"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Jonsdottir is an amazing player! A deserved win for Wolfsburg!
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Best move was Brand's pass to Bremer. It was a copy of the 2:1 by Germany against the USA in 2022, when Brand passed to Krumbiegel."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Arsenal were well beaten on their own turf too? The score flattered Arsenal, it could so easily been 2 - 6 to Wolfsburg, superb play from the Germans. Well deserved?"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"""it's a calamitous there..."" This commentator is such a liability."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Great game, the fighting spirit in both."
9Loh1C-GRHs,I'm very proud of this girls. Up Gunners 4 life
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal women🤝 arsenal men. Bottle both ucl and prem peak times for their fans
9Loh1C-GRHs,"yes dribbling next to your surface in the 118th minute, best decision xD"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Well Both Men and Women have bottled this season 🤣🤣
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Very entertaining game, both teams played well. Congrats to the winners wf"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"The gunners shooting them selves in the foot, cuddles to to wolf pack against all odds 🐺"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Great game.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Man Utd will come and wipe their tears next season ❤
9Loh1C-GRHs,Was Blackstenius called off side by VAR for her disallowed goal in the 47th minute? Looked legit to me
9Loh1C-GRHs,Disappointing  ... the Arsenal defenders didn't seem to full commit & put everything on the line  ... here & there at least .. Arsenal could have won this ...
9Loh1C-GRHs,Jonsdottir is an absolute unit!
9Loh1C-GRHs,I am glad arsenal lost bias female commentator the ref tried to help then non stop all game because how was that not a penalty and how was arsenal first goal in d build up not a foul overhyped English teams
9Loh1C-GRHs,keystone cops defending at the end
9Loh1C-GRHs,same arsenal every where
9Loh1C-GRHs,"I feel for arsenal players 😢, even in first leg in Germany they gave away same kind of goal.
The coach needs to change it bcz playing from the back need experience players who're quick or they need to learn the time of releasing such ball in terms of danger."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"I'm so happy that Wolfsburg won. And the only reason is because the commentary team especially the lady who is commentating was so biased! Every time Arsenal won a tackle or something age was saying well done, well done. But nothing for Wolfsburg. Pathetic! 

8:52 the silence was deafening from her here 😂😂😂"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Why does Arsenal have a keeper ? 
And the ball watching at the end was criminal. Wooflsberg robbed of a pen though"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"I cannot believe we, the Arsenal lost because of a blunder"
9Loh1C-GRHs,I really love women's football. Thanks for all these videos. I also suggest those https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppELWXqck-8&list=PLoMQcSDeHlC1A-v6_a2yzP8ngC56xZ_HI
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal fans can’t seem to catch a break 😂
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal bottled again xD
9Loh1C-GRHs,No love lost between those two teams. That cheap shot against Popp after the second Arsenal goal was very rough.
9Loh1C-GRHs,This looks like child playing
9Loh1C-GRHs,That's a penalty all day. Learn to keep your hands down
9Loh1C-GRHs,"There must have been thousands of children asleep during the extra time . Poor things . The early kick off didn't work . Plus all the ice cream they would have eaten too ..
Are the tickets for Tuesday nights game costing the same as the mummies and kids paid ?? Practically nothing 😂😂😂😂. A hamburger would cost more than their admission . Yet , the attendance is highlighted as often as possible . 
Delighted that Arsenal were beaten , by the way . 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
9Loh1C-GRHs,The bottle club has done it again 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 men women no difference
9Loh1C-GRHs,Its funny to see the away end gone
9Loh1C-GRHs,Better Chelsea women
9Loh1C-GRHs,"I'm waiting for the day when both women and men, will play football in the same team and end millennia of discrimination  against women."
9Loh1C-GRHs,Fair play to the 60063 fans who went 👏 but Lotte wuben moy.. deary me! What were you thinking?! 🙈 1 minute to go and you do that! 😬 silly sausage
9Loh1C-GRHs,Itz de iztory of the assna.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Why was the second Blackstemius goal disallowed?  When B punched it in the net she was behind the girl when the ball was crossed.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Christ even the Arsenal women have the same brittle mentality as the men
9Loh1C-GRHs,"I love Arsenal, but the UEFA Champions League Cup belongs in EUROPE, not in the UK.
Barca will be hard to beat, but this will be a fabulous Final."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"They play out from the back just like the men,  Useless."
9Loh1C-GRHs,English teams doesn't know how to play in CL.
9Loh1C-GRHs,"just like the men they're failures
9:55"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"What a shame that one of the English teams could not make the final ,think Wolfsberg will give Barca a game ."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"That was actually a penalty.

Her hand was in an unnatural position and was used to intercept the ball!

The ref is probably too jittery to do her job!"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Why arsenal thier men and women make same mistakes
9Loh1C-GRHs,lol imagine walking with the ball with your head down into the opponent with 2 mins left
9Loh1C-GRHs,Great coming Arsenal you need  to make deference Sorry for injury of Wienbor because of lionesses I'm ur side
9Loh1C-GRHs,Tbh Barca would destroy either of these teams
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal is the bottler fc.
9Loh1C-GRHs,2nd leg Wolfsburg was improved. However still easily loosing the ball. 23 was selfish. Shld start Brand regularly
9Loh1C-GRHs,"London is Blues, only Chelsea reach the Champions League final"
9Loh1C-GRHs,1:15 How was this not a penalty?
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal would have played worse honestly if they were healthy lol
9Loh1C-GRHs,Terrible to watch
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal and set pieces are made for me each other.. be it men or women 😂😂😂
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Both male and female, our set piece defending av been poor dis season"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Not being sexist or anything but jesus christ it's like watching 12 year olds play, people who think this is the same level as the men's game need their head checking"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"What a game ! Both teams were just amazing 👌
Congrats ladies 👏👏👏👏👏"
9Loh1C-GRHs,I just hope they don't let transgender woman to play or join competition or clubs. I am starting to enjoy this.
9Loh1C-GRHs,"When Huth missed that chance to put the game away mid-2nd half, I had an ominous feeling. Great that Frohms had that super-save in extra time and it didn't eventually get to penalties"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Chin up, Arsenal ladies! What a fight you put on in both legs of this tie!"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Arsenal seems to always bottle it all in the last minute, this was just a simple pass to her team mate or kick a long ball inside, i just don't know what she was thinking lol"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"What a great match. Suspenseful, punches exchanged all game long."
9Loh1C-GRHs,😔😔😔😔very dissappointed 4 this result..but Arsenal showed best performance until semifinal...comeback strongers gooners...❤❤❤from me🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨
9Loh1C-GRHs,why arsenal subbed Blackstenius and Jule Brand Ballon d'or
9Loh1C-GRHs,That was a penalty handball
9Loh1C-GRHs,Lol Arsenal female and male teams being the Arsenal we all know.
9Loh1C-GRHs,"I was rooting for arsenal, I thought they were more lucky than the Chelsea ladies whom where paired with both Lyon and Barcelona. Now the both england clubs are out. The question is, will arsenal even make an appearance in the next year's champions league competition. From what we see on the WSL table, man UTD, man city and cfc are really up there ahead of arsenal."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Not sure what the ref is having for breakfast tomorrow,  no doubt she will check with VAR. Very poor officiating at times"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Whoever VAR was shouldn't be in the sport.. no idea absolute  Muppet!
9Loh1C-GRHs,Barca's fans want against Arsenal in the final match😢
9Loh1C-GRHs,How was that not a pen😂 was the clearest hand ball i’ve ever seen
9Loh1C-GRHs,These girls seem better than US women. Better pay attention USA.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Congratulations Wolfsburg 🎉
9Loh1C-GRHs,"I think the right result.Wolfsburg should of had a pen in the first half,VAR joke.I've seen loads given for handball in the EPL for less than that."
9Loh1C-GRHs,arsenal skipped sportsmanship. well deserved loss
9Loh1C-GRHs,They just summed up in 120 minutes what their men's team did throughout the season.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal women is no different from the men lol
9Loh1C-GRHs,How’s the red not gave that penalty for handball for Wolfsburg? They wanted Arsenal to win so bad! Pathetic
9Loh1C-GRHs,Its amazing match. After few years women football will grow huge.
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Fancy Wolfsburg (what a fabulous name too, City of Wolves!!) but really feel for Arsenal fans after managing to pack the Emirates. Would have been the best final between the two strongest clubs in terms of following, let alone football quality. And achtung Leute, our Alexia is back! ;)"
9Loh1C-GRHs,nothing new arsenal giving others chance😂😂😂😂
9Loh1C-GRHs,What was that arsenal lady doing. Clear the ball and it's on for penalties. Hope they come back strong next season
9Loh1C-GRHs,Barca women will tear them apart
9Loh1C-GRHs,JULE BRAND is my new favorite player. The runs she made were game-changing and that classy play she made got them the winner.  Amazing energy and movement!
9Loh1C-GRHs,Barca has to be scared now.
9Loh1C-GRHs,AssNal bottled 🍼 it again 😅
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Wolfsburg, thanks for eleminating an english team. Great job👋👋"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"crazy game...Wolfsburg should have scored and closed out in the 69.min...was there not an offside position at the second Arsenal goal (7:10)? anyways, vs Barca I am routing for the she-wolves ;-)"
9Loh1C-GRHs,This dumb women trying skill someone up on edge of her box in 118s minute 😡😡😡
9Loh1C-GRHs,That was great struggle. Congrats Wolfsburg.
9Loh1C-GRHs,But always the referees decide for the island....unbelievable....
9Loh1C-GRHs,I've never seen a women's match where there wasn't a mistake at the back resulting in a goal. Just clear the ball!!!
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Playing out from the back with 2 minutes of extra time to go 🤦🏻‍♂️

Great effort though, should be proud. A fully fit team would of won that."
9Loh1C-GRHs,We didn't see the line offside goal
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Arsenal bottled it in Europe, a week after bottling the league in both men & women's football."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Pass it or boot it out ffs! When your ego outweighs your talent, this is what happens, Rookie mistake.🤣"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Like I said,  an English team will not be getting a UCL  title this year."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Great match! Unfortunate that yet another football match decided by an opponent taking the ball away from a defender in closing minutes of a game! 
It doesn’t seem to matter wether it is men’s or women’s leagues, pros or others, instead of keeper clearing the ball far into opponents half, the ball is passed around by the back line and taken away!! Give the forwards a chance to decide outcome, not the tired defenders!
Nevertheless congrats Wolfsburg! The final should be entertaining"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Bottled it like the men have with the league 😂😂😂😂😂
9Loh1C-GRHs,Not the time to play out from the back. Tired legs got the better of Arsenal
9Loh1C-GRHs,Nahh the victory screech?? We need that
9Loh1C-GRHs,That's just a horrendous mistake to make in the 118th minute.
9Loh1C-GRHs,why so long
9Loh1C-GRHs,"I was there at the stadium watching this 60,063 people where there it was crazy"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"To make it this far with all the injuries the Arsenal ladies first team have is an achievement in itself. In fact, Eidevall was about to pull a Champions League miracle. Well in ladies. And the RB should hold her head high! She was brave. Many players hide from such a pass esp in the last minute of a big game. She got it controlled perfectly with utmost composure, and even wanted to beat her opponent. In a champions league semi, that's brave!! Keep going girl even the best fall sometimes but they are the best because they learn from failure and keep moving!! COYG!! You made us proud!! Bless 🔴⚪🔴⚪"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Perfect! English teams out of Europe again 🤪
9Loh1C-GRHs,Lol why wasn‘t that first goal from Arsenal called back? Clear foul from Arsenal in their half before scoring the goal. Video didn‘t show the VAR decision.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Lol Catley 6:32
9Loh1C-GRHs,I would rather Wolfsburg win it on spot kicks.  Sometimes luck a is a cruel mistress but I am sure Lotte Wuben Moy is made of sterner stuff she would be back stronger.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Wobenmoye! Gifted Wolfsburg the final and possibly the cup.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Very nice game. Wolfsburg is the best 🟢🔥
9Loh1C-GRHs,Wolfberg will win it
9Loh1C-GRHs,England were lucky when Popp got injured during Euro 2022 final warm up she would have won it for Germany if she was fit.
9Loh1C-GRHs,"commentators are biased, they only support Arsenal"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Really well played from both teams ; some decisions didn't go arsenal's way though as they had 2 goals disallowed but we'll played from wolfsburg. Really great effort from arsenal but unlucky
9Loh1C-GRHs,What the referee
9Loh1C-GRHs,"So sad that English pundits won't be seeing an all English final, not even one English team 

Nevertheless I rooted for Arsenal even tho I'm not an Arsenal fan. Gotta love their fighting spirits despite heavy injury crisis"
9Loh1C-GRHs,What a match 🔥🥰🇬🇭
9Loh1C-GRHs,Merle has to get credit for them world class saves she made 💪
9Loh1C-GRHs,I just watched the highlights from the first leg. What's up with Arsenal's defense? They seemed kind of too laxed and not quite coordinated. That last goal was just given away.
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Heartbreaking, but so proud of these women. No Mead, Miedema,  Little, Ford, or Williamson - that's half the first choice team - but over the two legs, they made Wolfsberg (arguably the second best team in Europe) look ordinary. BUT,  they really do need to stop this fetish of playing out from back, when it suicidally invites pressure and consequent mistakes."
9Loh1C-GRHs,Blacksteinus playing along side Beth Mead and Miedema will be the strongest attacking trio coke next year. 🔥
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Who was offside in the buildup on Blackstenius' disallowed goal, or was it something else? Can't see from the camera angle on the video and they didn't show what VAR saw."
9Loh1C-GRHs,I hope Wiegman drops Wubben-Moy from the England squad after this game. First a handball then a howler in the last 3 minutes 🤦‍♂️
9Loh1C-GRHs,Disgraceful mistake for the 3rd wolfsburg goal. Female Rob Holding
9Loh1C-GRHs,what an exciting game
9Loh1C-GRHs,cant spell arsenal without L
9Loh1C-GRHs,"The girls did all we could've asked of them and then some. Eventually, it was just too much with all those injuries. The difference, in the end, was that the Germans, unlike us, had their biggest star back - Popp was vital with assisting the first and scoring the second.
We need to learn to finish the games though. Those two goals conceded in overtime against United, the late equaliser by Kerr against Chelsea, and now this. Season defining moments."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Brand came too late and Oberdorf does not look fit enough. Luck in the end, but these 2 aspects should be respected next time."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Hendrich (Nr.4) from Wolfsburg had today a nightmare day… not just by the first goal, but the whole game.., I don’t understand the coach, why he didn’t took her off… Wolfsburg was very lucky, that her mistakes were not really used by Arsenal… on the end, Wolfsburg won the game… but she (Hendrich) played on a amateur league game level today…"
9Loh1C-GRHs,"You wouldn't believe how many mistakes are made, in trying to clear the ball out from the goal area, between the GKs, and their defensive players close to them. This avenue for potential errors must be investigated and shut down. This is mostly in the women's game, where the GKS do not have a forceful enough kicking ability to get the ball out of harm's way, asap."
9Loh1C-GRHs,"Can't help but root for Arsenal given the season they had, but Wolfsburg deserved the win with this performance so fair play to them
Barca is probably going to run riot in the final anyway though"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Jule Brand was the Gamechanger 💚💚💚
9Loh1C-GRHs,"WHY, WHY, WHY do coaches preach this passing it around at the back nonsense, ""building from the back"" as they call it? And if coaches MUST persist with this mind-numbing tactic can't they coach teams to forget it when there are 3 minutes left and to just get the ball as far from their own goal as possible? Wolfsburg's winner goes down in my book as an own goal by the coaches and the fullback who tried to dribble the ball past an opponent in her own third of the pitch! Absolute suicide tactics which must cause fans to have heart attacks several times in a game when defenders get caught out by the simple tactic of pressing. Aaaaaaargh!"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Can't win a champions league semifinal if you make easy mistakes like that in both games. Why do they insist on playing out from the back when it never helps them and just gives the opponents easy goals? Is eidevall that stubborn or are the players just unskilled?
9Loh1C-GRHs,I wonder how many arsenal fans has been sent to the hospital because of this near success feat that our men women and youths had pulled this season. (well i'm glad for the cup the women won thi season). Well done hope we do well enough to win it next season. COYG. Great performance from our women's team.
9Loh1C-GRHs,Congrats to Wolfsburg
9Loh1C-GRHs,Barcelona >>> both
9Loh1C-GRHs,"It was so so close, I'm so sad and angry"
9Loh1C-GRHs,Arsenal and Wolfsburg didn't take their chances. Arsenal especially didn't in extra time. Gg
ET86gczHcrI,Women’s football is bad !
ET86gczHcrI,so boring
ET86gczHcrI,"post match celebrations

ET86gczHcrI,Thank you so much DAZN for everything you are doing for women's football
ET86gczHcrI,Beste team won. Wolfsburg more than deserved. Arsenal plays typical british. Kick & rush.
ET86gczHcrI,Popp is wife material 😍congrats Wolfsburg 🔥
ET86gczHcrI,"What a fantastic game and a what great advertisement for  Womens football! since Euro 22 it been a big thing for me personally and have had the privilege of watching die frauen mannschaft live against France and Sweden.

This was a game that had it all and it was end to end action and for me it was pleasing to see wolfsburg progress to the final.

Jule Brand  was the difference in the end between Arsenal and Wolfsburg she was simply the super sub who made things happen and her unselfish play shined through yet again!

Jule you truly are the Golden girl of football!   I'm looking forward to the final hope I get ticket for Eindioven!

ET86gczHcrI,"What a game, respect to Arsenal, they really really took it to us, what a game. 

We handled the Extra Time way better. Jule Brand coming in for the speed really opened up our way. She pressed and got us that moment. Great game from the She Wolves. Popp is so amazing."
ET86gczHcrI,"Hahaha come on Wolfsburg beat these English so called football players, don’t watch these English Women play in any Finals, lololol Well done 👏"
ET86gczHcrI,2:46:49 ist so gut <3
ET86gczHcrI,C'mon WOLFSBURG !!!!!!
ET86gczHcrI,Blackstenius what a monster
ET86gczHcrI,"I wanted Arsenal in the finals, but now Wolfsburg is gonna get what I kept for Arsenal."
ET86gczHcrI,well done wolfburg but I hope you won't win the final because I don't want you to come closer to Lyon 😅
ET86gczHcrI,Football is a harsh game wubben moy was class all game
ET86gczHcrI,Even the women are bums.
BsFVNSdvlyk,Rachel would beat Harry Maguire on a 100m track race. What an incredible pace!!!
BsFVNSdvlyk,Richard was the best player on the pitch
BsFVNSdvlyk,"Not just a year or two, RM is years behind Barca Women's team. I'm saying it as a Madridista! 
And what happened with Kathleen? She wasn't this bad before as a CB but it was an awful display from her."
BsFVNSdvlyk,Best Junior football i have seen in years.
BsFVNSdvlyk,Bit of a mental game.  Royal Madrid are always an enjoyable watch.
BsFVNSdvlyk,Andrea Pirlo would've approved of that Møller move before 2-2. Great stuff
BsFVNSdvlyk,Teresa what a player 🔥 I'm Barca fans and she is very talented Spain is lucky to have a lot of great midfielder in their squad
BsFVNSdvlyk,Real Madrid needs to fix that Defense!!
BsFVNSdvlyk,The sons of the Barca .........beautiful !!!!!!! .....me Río de Janeiro jajajajajaja

I hope she doesn't fall with a thud, on her face."

cs1x4OZH58I,"Outside force is tryin to hack the systems, nothing to hide young man~~🙋🙋"
cs1x4OZH58I,"I had tears listening to the Queen Alexia Putellas 😭👑
I am so in love with this club and everything related to it. 💙♥️
Visca El Barça. Més que un club."
cs1x4OZH58I,"I hope for her sake and for the sake of Spain, she is able to justify all the Hype that she is gathering around her.  I mean she has been out of real playing situations for a long time and is scarcely expected to be as sharp. She will be stepping out again on a Football pitch for the World Cup, for real. I hope she doesn't fall with a thud, on her face."
cs1x4OZH58I,Injured the whole season but will pop up and win the balon dor what a joke 😂
cs1x4OZH58I,"their is no rivalry in woman football and please are you not tired posting Alexia everyday, their is many players I'm VARcelona team stop posting only Alexia she is ovarated 🥱🤡"
cs1x4OZH58I,What a goal Zornoza scored in this game. Silenced the entire crowd.
WGGmCneSf68,"the 70s Brazilian team had players that would grace any other team on the planet such as Rivolino, Jaizino, Tostoa  But on top of that they had PELE, Barca also have great players that would grace any team Walsh, aitia hanson but thay have the jewel in the crown Alexia & yes i am making that comparison"
WGGmCneSf68,The goat of women’s football
WGGmCneSf68,"she didn't just make history for Spanish football. she's a football icon in general, and what she's been doing for women's football will never be topped."
WGGmCneSf68,The Most overrated Football Player in History of Football . . . Can't even pass a quarterfinal of any International Tournament ! . . . Certainly Can Never Get Past Lyon 😂😂😂😂😂
WGGmCneSf68,"Nice video. Thanks a lot!
We are all waiting for the Queen to come back!"
WGGmCneSf68,ovarated player
WGGmCneSf68,History maker 🎉🎉
WGGmCneSf68,"ALEXIA is the BEST FEMENI FOOTBALLER❤ in the World,, The REINA of FOOTBALL⚽⚽⚽ 💪💪💪🤗🤗😍🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🥰🥰🥰❤❤❤🙏"
WGGmCneSf68,She’s the best
WGGmCneSf68,but I more like Alex Morgan than Alexia Putellas .
WGGmCneSf68,Not just to decoded my friends .. SHE IS THE FOOTBAL QUEEN in this world for ever and ever ... Yesssssss ...
WGGmCneSf68,Can’t wait for the best footballer to be back 🐐❤️
WGGmCneSf68,Putellas Captain fantastic❤
WGGmCneSf68,Am from Africa Uganda but my sister only loves football because of Alexia❤

lO3XKwHlpxY,Congrats to Barcelona for making ucl women champions league final  again.
Wptmpw2ivJU,lets go forward  1 year.. Aitana destroying Chelsea again… same score 2-1 .. Aitana chelsea nightmare ❤❤😂
Wptmpw2ivJU,"The talent on Barcelona's team is mind-blowing, just incredible. It's hard to even rank  the players because they're all great.  Take Aitana, Paruello, Mapi Leon, Mariona, Oshoala, Marta Torrejón and Irene Paredes and put them on another team and you instantly have a top two team in the world and Barcelona still keeps its number one status with Alexia, Pina, Graham, Bronze, Fridolina Rolfö,  Paños, Ingrid Syrstad Engen, Esmee Brugts and Keira Walsh"
Wptmpw2ivJU,Chelsea
Wptmpw2ivJU,Chelsea is too much back passing.. move forward
Wptmpw2ivJU,"Sam Kerr big big big mistake.Without her Chelsea wud have won.Sam Kerr look at her games at elite level,defenders must be delighted to see her"
Wptmpw2ivJU,Look pan the amount of fouls that are happening rite in front of the referee and she is not calling them am a referee myself and a foul is a foul she is not well focus in this game
Wptmpw2ivJU,The referee is not fare in this game she made some mistakes in the game
Wptmpw2ivJU,"BARCA WERE NOT THAT FANTASTIC,,ONLY SCORED 1 GOAL"
Wptmpw2ivJU,Last play of the game and she didn’t fking cross it ffs that’s Chelsea fc in a nutshell this season
Wptmpw2ivJU,I supported the Barcelona win but Chelsea have proven me wrong. They did their best and improved. Nice one👍
Wptmpw2ivJU,❤❤Chelsea
Wptmpw2ivJU,Keira will play her first ever wucl final

suiRCBzlS1k,2:04:00 Chelsea heartbreak
suiRCBzlS1k,Fantastic game .
suiRCBzlS1k,❤❤❤❤waoo Barse Lona my fevraute team...
suiRCBzlS1k,Those English commentators are need to be banned cause they live under British Hypocrisy
suiRCBzlS1k,"English commentator are really trash, they are to biased. Barca deserve better commentator who respect them tho"
suiRCBzlS1k,what a game <3
suiRCBzlS1k,Who was able to hold on?😂😂😂😂
suiRCBzlS1k,Boring final now.
suiRCBzlS1k,Thank you for this channel 👏👏👏
suiRCBzlS1k,Camp mou the football cathedral
suiRCBzlS1k,I said it so often SamKerr big problem at elite level.Look at the recent preformances she was hopeless granted unable to get the feed.Its to easy to nullify her ability to contribute.Nobody see's cause the name is psycholigally ingrain like ronaldo latter time at utd.
suiRCBzlS1k,"YO PENSABA QUE: GIL MANZANO, MATHEU LAOZ, DEL CERRO GRANDE, HERNÁNDEZ HERNÁNDEZ ERAN MALOS ARBITROS HASTA QUE VI CUANTOS FUERA DE JUEGO INEXISTENTES NOS PITAN EN EL FÚTBOL FEMENINO...."
suiRCBzlS1k,Justice was done chealsea out for cheating last match Lauren James the man had dived hahaaaaaaa
suiRCBzlS1k,"Emma Hayes tactics were so boring, Chelsea had zero shot on target for 63 mins, and you called it well played."
suiRCBzlS1k,"Chelsea doesn't have uwcl mentality like other teams, I would say Arsenal is competing in much better way than Chelsea"
suiRCBzlS1k,This dazn commentators are from England and they always praise wsl teams. 2years before Chelsea were favourites and today they are like Chelsea fought hard. Double standards
suiRCBzlS1k,Raise you hand if you hate Barcelona ✋
suiRCBzlS1k,"Once more, Emma Hayes fails to send Chelsea in European Championship final. I know she is an idol for Chelsea fans but..."
suiRCBzlS1k,"This Chelsea is not the one i know 😏😏😏😏
They cant even complete 3 vital passes 🙄🙄🙄 
what os really happening .... abi dem swear for unaa. Erriskson should be sold ASAP!!! 
Todd Boehly release money to Emma Hayes cos they really need more players ."
suiRCBzlS1k,Thanks Barça!! The cheaters are out!!
suiRCBzlS1k,"once again great coverage & Barca looked magnificent & once Alexia is back in the team they'll look even better, BUT & i don't know why, i have a gut feeling that they wont win the trophy, don't know why just a feeling"
suiRCBzlS1k,Chelsea played so well
suiRCBzlS1k,"It was a fantastic game! So admirable performance! It was a final practically... pure electricity for each of their shooting... Giru's is great player... and Graham... pfff! Diamonds... Big duels between Geyse and Carter, Mjelde, Cuthbert Mariona... everyone... Keer's Assistances...  but Aitana... what a midfielder...  Resume 1:32:23 Graham... 1:35:53 Giru..."
suiRCBzlS1k,"This is just mediocrity from jona instead of finishing Chelsea in first half he choose to just hang in and won by small margin, i hope we get a better coach"
suiRCBzlS1k,"Play time 32.19...Chelsea (and Arsenal's) favorite move... a nod to the GK, she pretends she in pain, the rest of the team go for a coaching session with Emma Hayes (ipad already in  hand) ...THIS MUST STOP...failing that make it like American football, stop every 10 mins for a coaching...its a miracle that the second emma hayes finishes, the GK recovers as if by miracle !!!!!!! its become endemic in WSL...STOP IT NOW.....and i love how one of the physio's attending berger keeps looking back to emma hayes for her nod of ok !!!!"
suiRCBzlS1k,This Barça Femení team has got more 🥚🥚🥚 than their male counterparts.
suiRCBzlS1k,#CarolineGrahamBrilliat10💙❤
suiRCBzlS1k,"Bravo Barcelona, scored and had many more chances! How do Chelsea expect to win if Kerr made her debut in the attack on the 55th minute?!"
suiRCBzlS1k,What's wrong with the commentators always talking down on Barcelona? Or is it that they support Chelsea
suiRCBzlS1k,"Berger likes to act like she has a bad knee at least once a game, the simulation is abused in this team"
suiRCBzlS1k,Great games
suiRCBzlS1k,"Very proud of the way the girls battled today , not quite enough on the night ."
suiRCBzlS1k,I'm watching this in Spanish because I can't stand listening to Lianne Sanderson!
suiRCBzlS1k,The Barca coach’s mind was just to qualify but not to win by a huge margin looking at today’s selection and tactics
suiRCBzlS1k,One step away to win this tournament. Putella will be back in the final can't wait to see her brilliant performance once again
suiRCBzlS1k,"1 : 1
Barca won on aggregate.
Congratulations to all the players, hope to see you at WC 2023 in Oceania (NZ + AUS)."
suiRCBzlS1k,What's the final score ?
suiRCBzlS1k,It’s a pity my Chelsea couldn’t make it.
suiRCBzlS1k,VARcelona 🤡 paying ref as usual can't even beat Chelsea at camp Nou

gjVNGIS_izY,"Coaches like Jonas E need to get off their pretentious high horse and go and ask Chelsea's Emma Hayes for advice and commit money to assist in their knowledge as he seems to be fine with decimating national teams of their players to acl injuries and other injuries. The stats this season alone of how many players Arsenal hasn't given enough to prevent these severe injuries whereas Chelsea has prevented acl injuries, yet at the same time, Chelsea has so many other injuries. So where is FIFA, each national team associations, the league or club associations and tournament sponsorship giving more to support the players. By supporting the players to get the data and prevention skills, they support women's soccer/football and all together women's sports. And not just for professional leagues or national teams, this information needs to given to semi-pro, minor and house leagues so kids and coaches get the information to learn to treat their bodies and minds appropriately without having to take all the expensive courses and workshops. Put the information online for free access on the very basics so that it is available instead of hoarded and secretive as a competitive edge."
gjVNGIS_izY,Chelsea vs Arsenal ! . . . Hopefully !
gjVNGIS_izY,English pundits cant stand Walsh being on the bench. She is the most obvious option to be benched if Alexia is back😂
gjVNGIS_izY,"I have to say it's really nice to see this be so tight between these teams compared to last year, makes for a much less predictable race to the finish. And I can understand why none of these analysts are really giving Wolfsburg much of a chance there, especially when they can often struggle in away games on hostile grounds (Juventus, anyone?) which the Arsenal home ground absolutely will be. But nobody could've predicted that the Gunners would just hand over the 2 easiest goals Wolfsburg ever got on a silver platter either (or then make up for it!) so who knows. Doesn't really matter either way since nobody will stop Barca from grabbing the cup at the end anyway."
gjVNGIS_izY,It’s all to play for in the second legs. I’m nervous excited x
gjVNGIS_izY,How pathetic one pundit suggest Bonmati should be the one to come out for Alexia to come in all because Walsh played well forgetting Patri plays even better in the DM role😅
gjVNGIS_izY,"Liane Sanderson could sing like Louis Armstrong 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqhCQZaH4Vs"
gjVNGIS_izY,ARSENAL and Barcelona
gjVNGIS_izY,Two epic games
gjVNGIS_izY,ARSENAL WILL BE THERE
gjVNGIS_izY,I wanted to be Barca vs Wolfsburg but Barca & Arsenal are very hot this year.
gjVNGIS_izY,"James has mad ball control, but is utterly inconsistent, and can't defend. Very hard to justify her starting. Chelsea is really missing Kirby. Going forward Chelsea has real challenges with its backline. No combination has been solid this season. Perisset is still undercooked in the roll, Buchanan hasn't gelled, and Bright although adored by Chelsea and British fans alike is getting slower and slower. Chelsea needs an attacking right back like Bronze, Carpenter or Catley."
gjVNGIS_izY,I hope Arsenal make it
gjVNGIS_izY,I love Barca woman
gjVNGIS_izY,I need Wolfsburg vs Arsenal last week full match please Admin
gjVNGIS_izY,"Speaking about freak shows (in the nicest possible way): nice ""balance"" to the commentary team.
(Wonder if our host got around to actually watching the games?)
By the way, Graham-Hanson's left foot is her bad foot so Chelski's defense did well.
On the other foot, Rolfo likes it on her left; speak to Arsenal about what she can do with her right.
My hope is for Wolfsburg in the final --
who wants to hear injury excuses for the end of time as to why Barca creamed Arsenal (again) in the 2023 Final --
unfortunately Wolfsburg probably lost their chance at home."
gjVNGIS_izY,My prediction: FC Barçalona - Arsenal WFC
gjVNGIS_izY,Barcelona women's ❤
gjVNGIS_izY,"ARSENAL Women are the best, Being the underdogs. 😘😘😘"
gjVNGIS_izY,I wonder who sent Sam Kerr to be offside. In big games she just disappears.
gjVNGIS_izY,I cannot wait to watch these two epic games of football.
gjVNGIS_izY,Barcelona women are already into the Final... I cry for Chelsea 😂😂😂😂
xbQRflXw9E8,Though it's been years i still come for this video ❤❤❤
xbQRflXw9E8,"A year and a couple of months after this game happened. I can confirm that it has changed how the women’s game has evolved. 
Playing with a fully packed stadium has become the norm. 
I was there to witness history and now i feel like the ticket i bought was worth so much more than what i bought it for. Truly and incredible feeling to contribute to history and to one day share this with my children in the future!"
xbQRflXw9E8,I really appreciate the DAZN UWCL coverage
xbQRflXw9E8,Barcelona soccer teams never disappointed their fans🏆.👍👍👍
xbQRflXw9E8,Man that was emotional 😢
xbQRflXw9E8,I t makes me happy to see people support women's soccer and barcelona is an extraordinary team. I do think in Catalunya soccer is a symbol of Catalan pride and that helped I believe get so many supporters to the stadium.
xbQRflXw9E8,"“they chant alexia the way they chant for messi”, ive seen this documental so many times and that phrase naves fails to make me cry. women’s football came to stay"
xbQRflXw9E8,"The record was set in 1971 in Mexico City 120.000. World Cup Final Mexico - Denmark 0-3. But FIFA tried to hide it. Countries were forced to stop writing about it, just watch the documentary ""Copa 71"" Still this is a big step for womens soccer."
xbQRflXw9E8,Kudos to Barcelona and it's fans for making this huge. Truly Barcelona is taking the women's football to another level. Marketing is also important and key... New Stadium will make things much more grande.
xbQRflXw9E8,Changed football so much that nobody heard of it.
xbQRflXw9E8,Brilliant Watch I not a fan of the men’s team for my own reasons but love The women’s team and been using quite a lot of their players on EAFC
xbQRflXw9E8,"The impact this match had on the world of women’s football is undeniable. All of you girls out there in the fields and the crowds, you have done us proud."
xbQRflXw9E8,The women's game is here to stay and I am so proud of all that the women have achieved over the years. You go girls!! ❤️💥👍🏽
xbQRflXw9E8,Barcelona is really heart of football. No any club has contributed to sports as much as barca
xbQRflXw9E8,4:20 sent chills down my spine.
xbQRflXw9E8,Alexia taking a sweeping bow to the crowd didn't go off well. It is not just about one person but the whole team which gets you there. She smacked of arrogance
xbQRflXw9E8,It was great to see so much people attend. I hope more of those feminist go out and support women football. Keep it up women in football proud of you all.
xbQRflXw9E8,"Zornoza is a beast. Beware! 
HALA MADRID"
xbQRflXw9E8,What makes this game to change the football ?????
xbQRflXw9E8,No happen funking all white bad black
xbQRflXw9E8,"You know i had goosebumps watching the video and while sitting at my home watching this match i felt that coordination,emotion and bond that the players felt.I can feel that moment when the fans of you're club come to watch the match from different places,they come to support you there.I really think in that way that there are many clubs in football but barca is an emotion and i get goosebumps whenever watching the matches of barca no matter its mens or womens football but barca is everything.I remember watching the final of ucl (Barca vs Lyon)it was emotional to watch the moment when barca lost but winning is not everything,winning is a spirit and i felt like the barca players were having the spirit of winning the game.But then you can see how they won the uwcl final in 2023 against wolfsburg it was just incredible to see barca through the semifinals and final of the champions league and then to reach the final of uwcl and to win it obviously,it was a proud moment for barca fans and i really think that there should be equaliser in women's and mens football ⚽️ i think men's and women's  should be treated equal.Luckily now the womens football is getting that attention that they deserve but still there is no matter of gender,both men's and women's should be provided  the same opportunities to rech their full potential. Im in love with Messi and Alexia Putellas,the way they play is just amazing and can't be expressed in words,they both are simply the G.O.A.T🎉Legends........❤"
xbQRflXw9E8,Women always follow men no matter what matter men do they never create anything new
xbQRflXw9E8,Women soccer is ridiculous. Not even 10 percent of mens perfomance.
xbQRflXw9E8,The best team and best club in the world. 💙❤️
xbQRflXw9E8,C.D. TACON
xbQRflXw9E8,"The catalyst that changed the women's game was the 2015 Women's World Cup. Not this game. That WC, lead to the growth and popularity of the women's game that was able to lead to this Barca record, england record etc. Sponsors and broadcasting are still a very big challenge to watch regular season games that aren't quarter/semi/finals matches."
xbQRflXw9E8,"And that's why Barca's ""Mes Que Un Club."""
xbQRflXw9E8,First 3 mins & i was criying.... it was just the introduction of the vid...
xbQRflXw9E8,"Barcelona is truly a football heritage club, very impactful in every aspect of football and how its played in today's world."
xbQRflXw9E8,Never forgive this club’s board for the way they treated the Most Decorated Player of their Club
xbQRflXw9E8,Bernabeu for women's game
xbQRflXw9E8,"Johan Cruyff, the one who asked the Barca board to invest into women's football in the early 90s , simply the best 🫶🐐"
xbQRflXw9E8,Wow this was a very special game of football..😊
xbQRflXw9E8,Thank you girls for making this wonderful world a better place to live and to dream more ….
xbQRflXw9E8,"I just love how happy football makes people, regardless if its mens or womens football, this game is just so beautiful and I can never get over it. It's inspiring to see more support around womens football tho, this is just the beginning for us! Well done ladies!"
xbQRflXw9E8,Lol...oshoala didn't even play o
xbQRflXw9E8,"Barca femini plays football like they are dancing, like musical performance. Reminds me of pep's barca. Just beautiful to look at"
xbQRflXw9E8,"Its so emotional for those who love football,its amazing ❤️"
xbQRflXw9E8,Today is the day barca please win
xbQRflXw9E8,are you going to broadcast the world cup matches this summer?
xbQRflXw9E8,That was coool!
xbQRflXw9E8,As a culer this is emotion  ❤  Alexia GOAT Of women football
xbQRflXw9E8,Women Football won that day! ❤
xbQRflXw9E8,Barça is the best and the greatest team
xbQRflXw9E8,"Thank you,

A guitar fretboard, and the scientific application of frequency manipulation for Time Travel:

~  zzzTIME TRAVEL...~ 
https://youtu.be/KFqNmE6SFy8

Guitar playing = Time Travel: scientifically, the proof is simplified on my napkin (and explained in the Video):

The guitar's fretboard enable's removal of all ""written"" representation of said ""music"" - including the ""measure"" portion of written music. 4/4; 5/4 etc.. or the beat. When the TIME SIGNATURE is removed, BOOM - time travel. Voila.

The guitar: On each string the following occurs along the fretboard [Whole tone = 2 spaces on the fretboard. Half tone = a single space on the fretboard]: Whole tone - Whole tone - Half tone - Whole tone - Whole tone - Whole tone - Half tone (repeat) = THE MAJOR SCALE. 

Guitar is all together the coolest thing."
xbQRflXw9E8,Go back to the kitchen
xbQRflXw9E8,"Honestly this seems like a strange comparison.
They are 2 totally different Players.
If anything, put Oberdorf tackles.
If anybody see this highlights without knowing a thing about Womens football...they would think Oberdorf is some mediocre player instead of a Top 3 CDM in Europe"
xbQRflXw9E8,Great
xbQRflXw9E8,bread and games
xbQRflXw9E8,The barca squard is unbelievable. Their praying system is amazing. They deserve attention like that. One of the reasons i watched this game was because of la Reina Alexia Putellas. She is a superstar. They forced us to watch their matches ❤
xbQRflXw9E8,What did this game change in womens football exactly?
xbQRflXw9E8,The best women’s soccer can do is YouTube deal and these girls are hilariously bad at this. 15 year olds boys destroy them. This is not fun to watch.
xbQRflXw9E8,"Truly loved it, thank you"
xbQRflXw9E8,"As so often, people decide and show what they want. As it turns out, that is football. I'm happy when I see the enthusiasm, the joy, the incredible game. The people there – no one talking about which gender is playing. It's just soccer in all its beauty. ❤"
xbQRflXw9E8,I was there
xbQRflXw9E8,I’m really happy for them
xbQRflXw9E8,It's possible only when there is match between Barca and real Madrid
xbQRflXw9E8,We need more of these documentaries ! Really great work DAZN
xbQRflXw9E8,more than club for a reason
xbQRflXw9E8,"I watched the game live ❤
And as said in the video, I was searching Barca's pride in the women's team that time when the men aren't performing!
They are incredible
The game is incredible
Just like the fans, I watched till the stream ended that day, unlike all other days when I shut the browser/TV off as soon as game ends ❤
Visca el Barça ❤️💙
Viva Catalunya 💛❤"
xbQRflXw9E8,Glad you made a video about that game. Otherwise I never would have known it was played. Millwall was playing that day. 👍🏻
xbQRflXw9E8,"*The USWNT (USA Women's Team) is what changed women's football forever and the game that changed women's football forever is the 1999 World Cup final between the US and China.  90,185 fans attended the final.  It was record-setting.  Without the US, women's football wouldn't exist at present.*"
xbQRflXw9E8,"Marvelous document, thank you Dazn. It really was special when you look at the atmosphere and the Joy of peolple. Also the semifinal against Wolfsburg or the Euro final at Wembley were terrific ganes. Lets hope for an exciting World Cup in Australia and many more to come. Im glad many people are riding this wave of womens football. It looks like a more healthy and fresh environment to me."
xbQRflXw9E8,"Camp nou tunnel is one of the iconic tunnel. Whenever i see in cinematic view from above the tunnel, it fills me with excitement."
xbQRflXw9E8,"""The game that changed WOMEN'S football""
have to put ""women"" in the title cause real football has been around for centuries and this game did nothing for that."
xbQRflXw9E8,"This is what we love about Barca. Alexia is Barca and Messi is BARC, BARC is Messi and camp nou is our birth place"
xbQRflXw9E8,I support woman's football.
xbQRflXw9E8,Barcelona is changing the woman’s football game. They promote it more than any other club.
xbQRflXw9E8,Truly more than a club ;)
xbQRflXw9E8,"Sure hope the ticket prices are the same as the men's, Hope the attendance isn't manipulated because of cheap tickets."
xbQRflXw9E8,This game gave big meaning and changed everything about women's football ❤
xbQRflXw9E8,FCB is more than a club
xbQRflXw9E8,Heart of a champion Barcelona😘😘😘😘😘
xbQRflXw9E8,barca trashing madrid in the ucl is nothing new ;)
xbQRflXw9E8,Shes so hot
xbQRflXw9E8,More than a club!! ❤️💙
xbQRflXw9E8,we have to really appreciate what DAZN is doing behind the scenes also apart from the on-screen activities to build and expand women's football to more and more people. can't really deny the efforts are impeccable. a step closer to equality in sports. thanks.
xbQRflXw9E8,"MES QUE UN CLUB, FC Barcelona is surely more than a club."
xbQRflXw9E8,"Putelass 🥰😘😍😍,Always To be My queen in football History"
xbQRflXw9E8,More than a club❤
xbQRflXw9E8,"Barcelona revolutionized men's football, and now the women's. Mes que un club."
xbQRflXw9E8,"Barca is really a overwhelming team, its like prime barca but having messi injured and still untouchable. If they win the champions league this year like they have my full respect"
xbQRflXw9E8,Nothing new expected from a club such as Barcelona just as they revolutionized men’s football with Cruyff and Guardiola they are now doing it with the Women’s football too
xbQRflXw9E8,So emotional! I loved this video/documentary. 💙❤️🥰
xbQRflXw9E8,O Captain! My Captain! 👑🔵🔴
xbQRflXw9E8,"Proud that I chose to support the best club in the world and the most influential club in the history of football. ""More than a club"" is suitable only for barca."
xbQRflXw9E8,im 26 year old man and i cried multiple times Visca el barca
xbQRflXw9E8,More Than a Club 💙❤️
xbQRflXw9E8,"""Some 500 fans have shown up""
Ma'am, there's atleast 3,000 people behind you."
xbQRflXw9E8,"once again Excellent coverage. I went off (mens) football about 20 years ago, got tired of the histrionics then at the last women's  world cup i started to watch & enjoy the women's skill & the honorable wat they behaved from then on i am a massive fan of women's foot ball but still cannot abide the men's game i ignored the world cup, basically the mens game is too girly lol"
xbQRflXw9E8,"Alexia is a type of player you can idolize her with no hesitation 😅 her playing style fully different from other players❤ 
I'm from Bangladesh and she is my idol🎉 not only me she is a idol of miliion dreams😌❤"
xbQRflXw9E8,"take that, Franco"
xbQRflXw9E8,More than a club Barcelona the biggest football team in history not just by male football it’s more than that Barcelona basketball team is also the best
xbQRflXw9E8,"An awesome video! I am so proud to be that next generation that hopefully will play and experience these scenes, thank you to all the women who came before and those who are dominating now. This is not only about Barcelona, Real Madrid was very brave to step into this stadium and come out with a wonder goal. Insane scenes, and more to come!"
xbQRflXw9E8,"While people fight all over the world , female futbol is bringing a new light into women's sports . Equidad ❤️"
xbQRflXw9E8,"I wish the media would stop forcing this on us! If women's football is so popular then why doesn't it have its own peak time highlights show like  Match of the Day? Why doesn't it have its own Football Focus? Why do so called 'legends' of the women's game have to cover men's games and ruin them with their squealy, high pitched, 100mph commentary?  Why do we have to listen to women's opinions when trying to enjoy men's football?
Please, media, stop forcing the women's game on people who are NOT interested, it's intrusive!"
xbQRflXw9E8,"Feel so grateful to have seen Barça women play at Camp Nou. The most incredible atmosphere, never known anything like it!"
xbQRflXw9E8,Most tickets were for free.
xbQRflXw9E8,"Alexia is just one of those players, no matter what club you support, what country you're from, it doesn't matter. We all have the same amount of love and respect for her"
xbQRflXw9E8,of course Futbol Club Barcelona had to do it!!🔴🔵🔴🔵💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
xbQRflXw9E8,I was there... Truly  unbelievable ❤️💙🔥
xbQRflXw9E8,"This match really had it all: amazing atmosphere, classic rivalry, intense competition, spectacular goals, historic record, cultural impact… all-in-all, a brilliant showing of the beautiful game that is football. Glad this story is being (re)told; it deserves to be memorialized. Thank you, DAZN, for livestreaming back then and for featuring it still now. Investment, accessibility, and representation are crucial for progress! 👏🙌🤝"
xbQRflXw9E8,"Historic as it absolutely is, this match itself was in my view more the _culmination_ of a change that had already started, rather than being ""the change"" as such. And I'd also like point out how this very YT channel has absolutely been a vital part of said change, while I'm at it. 
Case in point, I myself have probably watched more whole matches of women's football in the past 2 years than all the years of my life before that combined!"
xbQRflXw9E8,"That day the women's Barça left an indelible mark on the history of world football. I am proud to support this club and proud of these players who gave everything on the pitch! 
That's why we are !Més que un club! 💙❤️"
xbQRflXw9E8,"Barcelona 21-22-23 is one of the best teams in the history of women's football but there is a huge asterisk next to its record.  Spanish Liga is a joke, is a one team league.  Barcelona wins all of its games (and I mean wins, not even one draw) is like a year long training session to be ready for Champions"
xbQRflXw9E8,”Madrid are close to Barça. Barça have gotten a lot of 1-0 scraps in recent results.” Flashforward Madrid are still yet to DRAW a game against Barcelona. They have lost ALL games they have met Barça. Put some respect on our team. They aren’t even close.
xbQRflXw9E8,Even the real Madrid womans team loves penalties 😂😂 as a barca fan I'm just hoping I get to see both mens and womens teams win a treble or quadruple in the same season 😊😊
xbQRflXw9E8,Goosebumps man. It was a really amazing match❤️💙💯
xbQRflXw9E8,Camp Nou was full during the world cup in Qatar for Barca's match. I was suprised and so pleased. Thank you Barca fans and all who worked to make this get to this level
xbQRflXw9E8,"To be a true Barcelona fan it's a fantastic experience 😘👏🏾💪
Ride on my wonderful ladies,..
🇳🇬"
xbQRflXw9E8,"This is why Barca is the greatest club ever when it comes to impact. They changed the way modern football is played, they changed women football forever. rich history, trophies to back it up and passionate fans all around the world. Greatest club of my generation"
xbQRflXw9E8,This was such a brilliant game of football which had the best atmosphere I’ve ever seen in any football game ever.
xbQRflXw9E8,"More than a Club ,  Más que un Club proud to be fan of this unique club 💙❤️💙❤️"
xbQRflXw9E8,This was indeed a spectacular moment. So great to watch. The Barcelona femeni team is the reason I enjoy watching women's football. I'm a Barca fan (men's and women's teams)
xbQRflXw9E8,What happened to  Alexia Putilas my Favorite women footballer.. Waiting for her to come back... 🙏
xbQRflXw9E8,I was here📷
xbQRflXw9E8,4:20 the goosebumps ..!
xbQRflXw9E8,The football club Barcelona is my life 💙❤️
xbQRflXw9E8,We're more than a club we're family ❤💙❤💙 visca el Barça
xbQRflXw9E8,"A nice story over a year of women's football at club level (this one) related to national level (Euro final). Thanks! It seems to focus on attendance as a measure of change/success.  Looking at women's World Cup stats, I note average game attendance in 1991 was 19,615 and in 2019 was 21,756; and peak attendance was in 1999 (90,185). So, I prefer broader measures to decide a 'game that changed football' such as: girls participation, add tv /online attendances, number of clubs and nations playing over time etc. I expect most will show continued growth. And I look forward to, and hope, in July that many national fans will travel here (ANZ) to boost average attendances. Doing so may show this match did indeed help change women's football!"
xbQRflXw9E8,"Hmm, not sure I agree with the title. The sheer number of fans must have been in response to something else, so this game was the RESULT of something that changed football."
xbQRflXw9E8,I pray Alexia is healthy for the World Cup!
xbQRflXw9E8,Will be in the away section on Thursday 27 April to see if my Chelsea Women can pull off another historic upset like the Men's team did at Camp Nou in 2012. It is amazing to think that I will have the opportunity to watch the last-ever Champions League football match at the old Camp Nou and it will be Women on the pitch for this occasion. Thank you for putting together this important video.
xbQRflXw9E8,Alexia putellas♥️ miss her magic this year
xbQRflXw9E8,I love the male team so it's only fitting to love the women's. ❤❤❤ Visca el Barça
xbQRflXw9E8,Alexia come back soon
xbQRflXw9E8,I nearly cried 😮😮 thank you❤❤❤
xbQRflXw9E8,Thank you DAZN for allowing Australia to watch these matches.❤
xbQRflXw9E8,I was there 😍🔵🔴
xbQRflXw9E8,"Thank you DAZN for allowing this US fan to watch this event live, it is a game as a lifelong women's football fan I knew was special even though I was a neutral fan. It brought tears to my eyes as a 58yo woman who never had a chance to play the game.
."
xbQRflXw9E8,It was the most beautiful moment watching Barça Femeni play in Camp Nou 💙❤️
xbQRflXw9E8,Miss Alexia putellas hope she come back soon. I wish she win the world best again
xbQRflXw9E8,I am proud to say i was there ! Visca el Barça y Visca Catalunya 🔵🔴
xbQRflXw9E8,They deserve the recognition.

xbQRflXw9E8,Thank you DAZN for always showing women's matches for free❤❤
xbQRflXw9E8,"The club that I love, that is a part of my life💙❤️"
xbQRflXw9E8,"Women football has been overwhelmed ten years ago for those who love the game but is surfacing now because of talents,skill,hard work, love and friendship of these excellent players that became something even more than football than nobody ever imagined before that's why so many people showing up."
xbQRflXw9E8,history is being made with these ladies 🫶🏻
xbQRflXw9E8,"Barcelona's women team is the reason I'm watching the women games 
Watching them reminds me of prime Barça
I really hope they win the Champions league this year"
xbQRflXw9E8,I was there. Great atmosphere
xbQRflXw9E8,"What moved me the most when I watched the games at Camp Nou and Wembley was the effect it had on the faces of the young girls in the crowd. Here were heroes of the woman’s game being acclaimed in front of them by colossal numbers. How many of those young girls will go on to be heroes of the game themselves? How many will go on to move the world in so many other ways because they were shown, in no uncertain terms, that women can and will do anything?"
xbQRflXw9E8,Attendance record trend started from here❤💙
xbQRflXw9E8,The club of my life ❤️🔴🔵
xbQRflXw9E8,greatest team
xbQRflXw9E8,they gave away the tickets. this in reality counts for nothing. try having actual paying crowds.
xbQRflXw9E8,"The recognition that this great group and this magnificent institution has won and deserves.
There would be no Women's EUROs as it was without this match, this day, this team, this squad, this institution.
Visça el Barça-Visça el Catalunya.
Més que un club."
xbQRflXw9E8,For the love of Barcelona FC❤
xbQRflXw9E8,"Should be the ""Match"" that changed..."
xbQRflXw9E8,Say what you want about Barcelona but I think its the best Club in the world and truely more than a club ❤
xbQRflXw9E8,"UWCL beautiful!
Women Euros ⚡️

Thank you DAZN!"
xbQRflXw9E8,Finally😊😊
xbQRflXw9E8,it changes nothing
xbQRflXw9E8,What a night!
xbQRflXw9E8,❤ Barcelona But I miss Alexia putellas so much Hopefully She plays soon

J7Vot7JSaCc,What a revenge from Real.
J7Vot7JSaCc,Caicedo☆Athenea☆☆Caroline☆☆☆ 💥
J7Vot7JSaCc,Caroline the GOAT
sh-ZTLFblko,Both arsenal men and women teams defense is so bad
sh-ZTLFblko,I love arsenal but I have a feeling that Barca will win
sh-ZTLFblko,I don't see a lot of competition for Barca from either side
sh-ZTLFblko,"Katie McCabe at it again. Getting an unnecessary yellow card because she can’t keep herself in check. It only benefits her opponents, so carry on!"
sh-ZTLFblko,arsenal is massive
sh-ZTLFblko,referee was so bad
IuPzyJRV1cg,32:40 Oops easy goal
IuPzyJRV1cg,"Oberdorff and McCabe, two fighters... and both, great players."
IuPzyJRV1cg,brilliant coverage
IuPzyJRV1cg,"Dissapointing performance by Wolfsburgo mainly beacuse Arsenal have half of starter injured and can we talk about Mccabe i think she deserved a red card,, but if Wolfsburgo not win at least 2-0 this match they should be worried the winner of semifinal 1 still favorite"
IuPzyJRV1cg,Jonsdottir block pajor celebration
IuPzyJRV1cg,"61.00 zinsberger down...this has got to stop...the GK suddenly, and for no reason, collapses to the ground so all the team then go for 'extra' coaching session...its funny that as soon as the coaching stops, she miraculously get better !! this is becoming endemic in WSL...all REFs STOP THIS NOW...."
IuPzyJRV1cg,"Love the spirit, never back down girls. #loveyou#little#foord#arsenalladies"
IuPzyJRV1cg,"1:56:15 is a straight red card for McCabe, I don't understand the decision to only give a yellow card."
IuPzyJRV1cg,"Lucky day for the gunners, because the 2:2 was an offside goal 😮!
   Also, McCabe should have gotten a red card for the intentional assault 😖 against Oberdorf. Ansolute unsportsmanlike and unnecessary hazard👎.
Very weak referee 😵‍💫 👎."
IuPzyJRV1cg,What celebration did 1st goal do
IuPzyJRV1cg,neither of them beats Barcelona
IuPzyJRV1cg,Great game. Wonderful comeback by the Gunners. I hope they can finish the job in the return leg.
IuPzyJRV1cg,Wolfsburg - the lucky draw team. We can be expected from the team with poor ball control & poor ball passing - the 2 basic skills in football
IuPzyJRV1cg,I love this channel soooooo much.
IuPzyJRV1cg,Wolfsburg wins in London. No doubt about it. Like they did away against Paris SG and Bayern München
IuPzyJRV1cg,"Up gunner, what a come back, excellent job"
IuPzyJRV1cg,referee was so bad
IuPzyJRV1cg,Only arsenal can do comebacks this season
IuPzyJRV1cg,Woman football trash
IuPzyJRV1cg,I see Jonas build this team by amount of player put the Arsenal play with great system even miss a crucial player still can play on very high level game.
IuPzyJRV1cg,Knew the gunners would do their thing.. should have won but great work!...💪second leg will be ours no doubt
IuPzyJRV1cg,"Great result for Arsenal after being 2-0 down , fancy them for the final now"
IuPzyJRV1cg,great playing from both teams !!!
IuPzyJRV1cg,from 2-0 to 2-2

hITemNjXkDg,This Caroline is just increabble.
hITemNjXkDg,"Without being at their best Barcelona dominated Chelsea at their house, I can't wait to see what they can do @ Camp Nou!!😄😁😉"
hITemNjXkDg,If only Lyon wouldn't have been robbed by Chelsea and the referee. OL would have offered a real match and would surely have beaten this Barça. ❤️💙
hITemNjXkDg,This game 😴
hITemNjXkDg,The girls
hITemNjXkDg,"I really hope Lucy Bronze is ok. Think Barcelona have done enough. Can’t wait to see a very noisy 90,000 at Camp Nou in a few days. Should be a cracking second leg."
hITemNjXkDg,🎉🎉 without ALEXIA 😢
StRJuKYKZFo,"44:01 She isn't saying it hit her in the face. That gesture is for a Spanish expression ""Having a hard face"". It's said when someone has done something that she/he should be ashamed of."
StRJuKYKZFo,"Go to bed shut up
Or ill get you"
StRJuKYKZFo,Whenever you play Chelsea you also have to play against the Ref!
StRJuKYKZFo,"This is a great game with great teams. Imagine, the talent  with Sam, Hansen, Mapi, Atiana, Rolfo, My favorites are Barca but, WoW, what a game the camera does not do it justice.With the equipment, they could do a lot better on the individual effort."
StRJuKYKZFo,"Wow, I just saw Mapi in the backfield, this game is in the bag!
iguana"
StRJuKYKZFo,Nice matches ❤🌹👍💞💓
StRJuKYKZFo,this must have been painful for the commentator. she desperately wanted chelsea to win. Bwaahahahahahah!!!  🤣🤣🤣🤣
StRJuKYKZFo,"Chelsea do conquer so far , all Teams except Barcelona who prove more resistance !!"
StRJuKYKZFo,"This is my first time watching an entire female match an now I wanna see how this ends. Next leg here we goo, and yes ik the match happened a few months ago but am jus seeing it 😊"
StRJuKYKZFo,As early as possibility.
StRJuKYKZFo,why is there man city girl in the thumbnail bro thought we didn't notice 
StRJuKYKZFo,FC Barçalona is the best club in the world ❤💙
StRJuKYKZFo,"Hope DAZN/UWCL will get a new commentators. These two ladies just talk too much shii.
That solo guy commentating from previous match PSG vs Wolfsburg is perfect."
StRJuKYKZFo,All coaches respect All girls I Loved All coaches of habit and All time my best game girl football real
StRJuKYKZFo,ngl i’m happy that 700k people watch women football
StRJuKYKZFo,"This Barcelona W side is just pure football, Jonatan Giraldez is one manager to watch, the Pep Guardiola of W football"
StRJuKYKZFo,Sam Kerr’s ball IQ is pretty insane. So is Bronze’s. Look how she laid an offside trap for Kerr
StRJuKYKZFo,The reporting was so crummy that I turned off the sound. Who needs them anyway. The woman was coarse and blindly biased. Is this the best DAZN can afford? There actually are qualified professional football commentators out there but they don't work for pennies.
StRJuKYKZFo,"Too bad that shortly after half-time Chelsea hat 7 fouls and Barcelona had only one questionable foul. Game statistic like shots on frame made Chelsea look bad. It wasn't only the goal that put Barcelona ahead, it was their better playing overall. They were just better. But these games really mean so very little because they are a fiesta of foreigners and not a Spanish city vs. a UK city. Two or more Brits played for Spain for example. Local patriotism and a little pride in your country folk can never arise under these circumstances. Something is systemically wrong when you cannot even be proud of YOUR team."
StRJuKYKZFo,Chelsea midfield balance has been a problem for awhile...
StRJuKYKZFo,Barca should move and play in WSL not in Liga F.
StRJuKYKZFo,The goalkeeper of Chelsea dd a great job
StRJuKYKZFo,"Glad to see Pernille Harder is back and hope, Lucy Bronze is not seriously injured!"
StRJuKYKZFo,"Brilliant goal, however I can understand why they get paid so much less... There's just no element of competition it's like they're having a coffee and occasionally someone interrupts them. There's like no real desire to be the best."
StRJuKYKZFo,"Chelsea defense saved them. Honestly,  I love how Bracelona plays"
StRJuKYKZFo,5:55 Mapi got bulldozed 😳 ...but smooth how she popped right back up.
StRJuKYKZFo,To many ads on this match hard to watch
StRJuKYKZFo,This video is awful. The audio commentary is lagging about 7 minutes behind the gameplay.
StRJuKYKZFo,"Luck day for Chelsea, or? Barcelona has two 100% chances left."
StRJuKYKZFo,well done  Barcelona
StRJuKYKZFo,Putellas will be back❤
StRJuKYKZFo,I was at the stadium whatching the game
StRJuKYKZFo,Too much biased commentary. Two teams are playing not only Chelsea
StRJuKYKZFo,Walsh and Bronze 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🤍
StRJuKYKZFo,VAMOS POR OTRA CHAMPIONS!!! SOMOS EL MEJOR CLUB QUE HA PARIDO LA TIERRA 🤫🤩😍💙❤️💙❤️
StRJuKYKZFo,"Love your videos and this free coverage of the games. Just one small issue: Can hear what might be Spanish commentators in the background - your microphones seem to be picking them up too. Might be something worth experimenting with your sound setup, and trying to eliminate for other games."
StRJuKYKZFo,"Barcelona were all over them, the only reason it wasn't 4-0 was the brilliant Chelsea defence. 👍"
StRJuKYKZFo,Idk what happens to barca when they play Lyon
StRJuKYKZFo,Please can you add the commentary language to the title for live streams.  I always select the wrong one!
StRJuKYKZFo,I don‘t even know which team i want to Support…
StRJuKYKZFo,Chelsea ❤
StRJuKYKZFo,Resume about this match... 06:33 (67 sec.). Indra´s arrow by Graham.
StRJuKYKZFo,Need improvement in passing. Sam Kerr was poor today.
StRJuKYKZFo,Horrible time to play 😡
StRJuKYKZFo,14:24 😲 CGH’s goal is almost a carbon copy of the one she scored last week against Atlético Madrid. Guess she found her sweet spot now!
StRJuKYKZFo,1:58:43 Oshoala dribble it out the field. 1:55:54 she can't even control the ball. No wonder she was on the bench...
StRJuKYKZFo,DAZN needs to sack the commentators. Disgraceful and totally biased. I bet the two morons wore the Chelsea shirt at the booth. Glad that Real Madrid mopped the floor with the men's game.
StRJuKYKZFo,Bye bye Chelsea!
StRJuKYKZFo,What biased commentary? It's two Chelsea die hard fans talking about Chelsea only. Fire those commentators. Chelsea are one nil down but those dazn clowns are talking as if Chelsea are 5-0 or something. Absolutely pathetic to see such bias in the UEFA Women's Champions League
StRJuKYKZFo,what a strike :OOO
StRJuKYKZFo,"""Advantage goes to Chelsea"" 😂"
StRJuKYKZFo,first gaol is crazy ❤‍🔥
StRJuKYKZFo,Barcelona had more English players in their team
StRJuKYKZFo,Barcelona with away important win vs Chelsea from Hansen
StRJuKYKZFo,"cant wait at camp nou🤟🔥, LFG BARCA❤🔥"
n7kfjT3NQEM,Rolfø really needs to work on her speed.
n7kfjT3NQEM,Anybody knows when Alexia Putellas is coming back to play? Thanks

q-rTs-U9RkI,Wow! Sandra is beyond gorgeous ❤ also an underrated keeper tbh

iMYxjyQ2fR4,MAANUM IS ON FIRE ❤🤍
iMYxjyQ2fR4,MAANUM IS SUPER AWESOME
iMYxjyQ2fR4,"For what is this comparison? They play different positions and Lattwein has a broken collarbone.... Go Wolfsburg, go!"
iMYxjyQ2fR4,1st of all completely different positions and secondly lattwein is injured 🤨
iMYxjyQ2fR4,"Maanum, she has grown into a goalgetter in Arsenal. And her precise shot is a nightmare to goalkeepers!"
iMYxjyQ2fR4,"It's obvious Frida Manuum is tastier.

Let's go Gunners!!  💪💪
Love you y'all ❤️❤️"
iMYxjyQ2fR4,C'mon the Gunners! I'm looking forward to this tie as Wolfsburg Women's Team are a step up in quality opposition imo 👌
peXtyX5FIDY,She's Lovely
peXtyX5FIDY,She's always shy
peXtyX5FIDY,"Geyse is going to be massive after the World Cup. She is such a talent and has improved so much since signing for Barca. It just goes to show that if you give players the proper facilities and resources, they will excel. Clubs across the league need to invest more in their women's teams to see these improvements. In turn everybody benefits as the product is of a higher quality and attracts more viewers."
peXtyX5FIDY,"Please DAZN more Geyse!! A lot of stars will be born in this world cup and judging from the two friendlies with both England and Germany, Geyse is at the top of that list. Can't wait for the world to see her talent 😊"
peXtyX5FIDY,"Geyse, I wanna see more DANCE from you girl...."
peXtyX5FIDY,Geyse TITULAR!!!!!💙❤️
peXtyX5FIDY,"Once the renovations for Camp Nou are complete, If organised properly, it would be brilliant seeing 100,000 every home game for both men and women. League games, UCL, Copa del rey / raina. I love Barca’s one club ethos, their facilities are top notch."
peXtyX5FIDY,"Bring us the Champions League home, we believe in you, visca Barça ❤"

xvzvx3h-ErE,"I got them all right except the Eurovision Q.  BUT the big takeaway is how to pronounce ""Van Gogh"".  And yes.  I'm looking at you, America..."
0XcgPClgN9k,"Its all nice and everything, if you compare it to the conditions of other women club teams for example in the bundesliga in Germany. But if you compare it to the Fc Bayern men section that's just a huge joke! I hope more people start to see the potential of women in sport more , especially in those big rich clubs like fcb, and support them more like they deserve:) 
Thanks Jovana for showing it, it was fun!"
0XcgPClgN9k,"jovana has the passion and the fire , visible whenever she is on the pitch"
0XcgPClgN9k,Hopefully facilities will continue to improve as the game grows. Nice to get to know Jovana a bit off the pitch.
0XcgPClgN9k,Make a video about Barcelona
0XcgPClgN9k,"enjoyed the vid.  glad to see Jovana can smile  :)   rarely see it on the pitch, shes all business   :)"
0XcgPClgN9k,I'm early
X9hqZoF97zQ,"that alex popp goal against psg was fantastic. just the form on it, the touch"
X9hqZoF97zQ,Where is aitana Bonmati 6 games 5 goals 6 Assists this is a joke
X9hqZoF97zQ,Leah Williamson and Mapi Leon are my favourites ❤❤❤
X9hqZoF97zQ,I think paraluello(sorry if I spelled it wrong) deserves this more than blackstenius
X9hqZoF97zQ,No Aitana really?
X9hqZoF97zQ,If Scandinavia FC became a team they'd scoosh the WCL.
X9hqZoF97zQ,"The first two shouldn't count, it's a penalty shoot out"
X9hqZoF97zQ,Thanks DAZN ❤❤
X9hqZoF97zQ,"Personally I would have liked to see Cuthbert make the team because she was great against Lyon, but she is up against some really strong players."
X9hqZoF97zQ,I agree
a5D254_HR6c,The Assist For Me
a5D254_HR6c,"Why didn't they show Lyon's “penalty” on James? It's a 128th minute tie decider, hugely contested by neutral spectators, yet you hide it? Tut, tut, tut.... 🤨"
a5D254_HR6c,Mate give the music a F--cking rest
a5D254_HR6c,So how does this video have anything to do with your headline write up. Or you just want to earn followers and likes using Arsenal name. You are a disgrace
a5D254_HR6c,Just a friendly reminder that Arsenal isn't getting a trophy this year
a5D254_HR6c,https://youtube.com/@_.mab7._?sub_confirmation=1
a5D254_HR6c,This barca team is just not unstoppable
Lex0JlHOPkg,Can you cut the scenes that no sentence be interrupted
tMzammZuK5o,"NIce of the local infant school to lend them this pitch !  the Geyse foul was sooooo deliberate and the arrogant way she then walks off, should have been a red card"
tMzammZuK5o,Come on braca
my3PuEMMNP4,ahahah It's merely a clown fest
my3PuEMMNP4,Barca's femini is the best ❤️💙💪
my3PuEMMNP4,I honestly enjoyed this ❤
my3PuEMMNP4,What a team arsenal ❤
735LtBt6I5o,"top 10 saves of the secon leg and the first one starts with the commentor saying ""straight in the arms...""  i just can't with you... make a top 5, would look less sad becaus the top 5 saves were actually worth talking about..."
735LtBt6I5o,Ceasar's safe was the best - by far!
735LtBt6I5o,4:04 Ann-Katrin Berger saves for a Semifinal.
735LtBt6I5o,"without Grohs, Bayern would have lost 5:0 to Arsenal"
4_bgyr5TbAg,"i use to hate womens football, now i absolutely love it xD"
4_bgyr5TbAg,meet barcelona will surely lose😁
4_bgyr5TbAg,All the best to Melanie!
4_bgyr5TbAg,Shocking how Bayern had absolutely no chances.
4_bgyr5TbAg,Why has Roma Keep such a short goal keeper
4_bgyr5TbAg,It's clear must be not penalty for Chelsea. Lucky
4_bgyr5TbAg,#French bashing
4_bgyr5TbAg,"Watch the replay, Lyon player clipped Lauren’s foot. Fact is, it was an undisputed penalty. Face the truth people. I do add that the ref wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed, turning a blind eye when the angry little Dutch girl damaged  Leupolz’s nose. That should have been a red card."
4_bgyr5TbAg,"DAZN wow 1080p that is actually 1080p !!! the full games was supposedly 1080p60, and was the usual fuzzy nearer 480p...why cant whole games be this clear and sharp ???????????"
XVRlNJxakqA,Came back to this and I want to say Lauren James is a brilliant player
XVRlNJxakqA,March 28 im here in emma hayes we trust
XVRlNJxakqA,"The person with the highest score in this match is Danielle Van de Donk.
A completely different game from the first half, Lyon needs to understand the value of the bright Dutch star. Chelsea players didn't even have the desired passes with DvD's smart play and high pressing!"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Its not penalty.
Anyway, congrats chelsea"
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren gameplay like Reece 💙
XVRlNJxakqA,The Best team lose
XVRlNJxakqA,😂😂😂😂😂😂 they are so funny
XVRlNJxakqA,Nice extended highlights ❤❤❤❤
XVRlNJxakqA,Anybody help me with the name of the comentator please
XVRlNJxakqA,Vamos Chelsea 🔥🔥🔥
XVRlNJxakqA,"But honestly, was this really the best thumbnail pic you could think of for this clip?! I mean, just look at that hand placement..."
XVRlNJxakqA,"The Chelsea goalkeeper illegally overtakes in the 2 penalties she saved. I don't know if in the female the rule in penalties is the same as in the male. The referee was very weak, she didn't see the overtaking, she didn't see the penalty at minute 120, they had to warn her about the var and the backhand that they gave Melanie Leupolz who had to leave due to the endless bleeding she had from her nose didn't see it either."
XVRlNJxakqA,Am a Chelsea fan but that first assist and goal from Lyon ladies was sweet.
XVRlNJxakqA,Bravo....am happy for my club
XVRlNJxakqA,"The one that took the penalty, then stepped up first in the shootout has massive balls under pressure"
XVRlNJxakqA,"No penalty, no way thats a penalty, ex ref."
XVRlNJxakqA,Out make team will also knockout the make champions league holders Real Madrid
XVRlNJxakqA,Jessie Fleming stepping up for a PK for Chelsea ..... reminded me instantly of the Japan Summer Olympics. (Does she ever miss a PK?)
XVRlNJxakqA,"Nice saves, those goalkeepers are top notch in the women's league"
XVRlNJxakqA,Maybe the men can take a bit from this.
XVRlNJxakqA,All the people that watched the match but stopped at 120 mins should be watching the replay after every match. Imagine that it was after you left watching that they won.
XVRlNJxakqA,It was dramatic match.
XVRlNJxakqA,I love Chelsea from Thailand
XVRlNJxakqA,For me it's the Drogba run buy the goal keeper😅🥇🏆💯💪🇯🇲🙌🏿🙂
XVRlNJxakqA,"All the males you see here,we're forced to come by their girlfriends"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Real Madrid be like: nah Lyon Feminin is too weak, let us teach Chelsea a lesson."
XVRlNJxakqA,That's not a penalty for Chelsea woman.
XVRlNJxakqA,"As usual . Anyone plays against a British team and referees begin whistling as referees to Barcelona in la Liga. Only time is was right was the final of 66 . But after everything divided is always on the bit team (as if Europe is  a colony of UK and they have to have always the benefit. I'm not a fan o Lyon or Chelsea . ""se got clicked"" and you are blind .  There are a lot of games where brit players hit even harder and you guys ignore it or play nothing happend."
XVRlNJxakqA,"Eriksson is a liability in that defence.

I can't wait for Millie Bright to be back, so she's dropped to the bench."
XVRlNJxakqA,why were lyon so mad about the pk>? what were they complaining about>?
XVRlNJxakqA,"Lots of comments about the last-gasp penalty for Chelsea. Of course there is contact but James leans into her opponent to create it. The defender does not make a tackle at all, she just ""jockeys"". Not a penalty in my view. Chelsea so, so lucky."
XVRlNJxakqA,missed the clip of leupolz getting her head bashed in this game was literally war out there it had everything
XVRlNJxakqA,YNWA ..well done Chelsea..
XVRlNJxakqA,I am a Chelsea fan and that wasn't a penalty. She kicked herself.
XVRlNJxakqA,Very generous penalty! Lyon played better and deserved to win
XVRlNJxakqA,"Women Football Grown like wow

What a game KTBFFH 💙💙💙"
XVRlNJxakqA,I thought Lyon would have gone through with away goals
XVRlNJxakqA,When did Chelsea score their second goal?
XVRlNJxakqA,Did anyone come here jus to see Melanie Leupolz injury…I mean I really don’t see why another reason why to… women’s football hella boring 🥱
XVRlNJxakqA,"Jessie Fleming also scored a Penalty, not shown... 🤔"
XVRlNJxakqA,Joke of a penalty lol
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea penalty isn't deserve I think for me as Chelsea fans but this kind of case type is usually happen at least we've going to semi finals 😁
XVRlNJxakqA,What a game!!!!
XVRlNJxakqA,Clear and obvious error?
XVRlNJxakqA,How is that a pen 😂. Getting level with the mens game I guess with shocking VAR calls
XVRlNJxakqA,"That Chelsea lady knows how to take a penalty. Unlike Neymar and other ""experts""."
XVRlNJxakqA,How is this a penalty?
XVRlNJxakqA,Kepa definitely trained Berger on penalties
XVRlNJxakqA,"Soft one, but she was clipped"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea 🔵
XVRlNJxakqA,Superb by Chelsea
XVRlNJxakqA,Best womens match I’ve seen so far by far
XVRlNJxakqA,So women goalkeepers are allowed to come off their line in penalties but men aren’t? Is that a rule now is it?
XVRlNJxakqA,Seriously poor quality
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James and his brother Reece are amazing players
XVRlNJxakqA,Congratulations our Chelsea ladies
XVRlNJxakqA,Hope the boys can do it
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James cheated at the end to get that penalty !!!!  OL LYON did the job !
XVRlNJxakqA,That was nice to watch #CFC
XVRlNJxakqA,Great game! Turn down the Vol on the commentator!!
XVRlNJxakqA,Recce James must teach her sister how to take spots
XVRlNJxakqA,"When you can't win, you cheat, nicely done James, what a player, what a diver ! 🤣"
XVRlNJxakqA,Incredible game but Chelsea is lucky. Well done but Barcelona will crush them next round. 0 chance to get the final. Chelsea is an old version of kick & rush.
XVRlNJxakqA,It's an outrage  !
XVRlNJxakqA,Was never a penalty. Referees seem to give English teams penalties all the time now. Its become very predictable
XVRlNJxakqA,Surely each save was off the line? Chelsea fan here btw but the last pen was 6yr box 😂
XVRlNJxakqA,"Vamos Barca , thank you Chelsea for KO the French champ , who’s always a hurdle for Barca in UCL .My vote goes to Barca to win UCL.Chelsea deserves it today .Superb Game ."
XVRlNJxakqA,That’s not a pen!!!
XVRlNJxakqA,That's not penalty!.. Lyon was robbed!
XVRlNJxakqA,I love Lauren James but that was not really a Penalty. She just threw herself down ro get a Penalty. The first Penalty for Lyon was supposed to be retaken because The Chelsea Goalkeeper came out of her line before the Penalty was Kicked. Why not use the same rules in Women's Soccer football as they are used in Men's?
XVRlNJxakqA,"Well done, but the case for Equal pay, I don't think so if this is the top quality football on show, then there is a very long way to go in Quality. But very well done in getting to the semi-finals Ladies."
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James really need to work on her shooting accuracy
XVRlNJxakqA,Great fight and determination! Well done Chelsea Ladies !
XVRlNJxakqA,"Despite the qualified Chelsea hardly spring passes together last night 
And I was so annoyed...
Congratulations to them though"
XVRlNJxakqA,My Queens!
XVRlNJxakqA,That was not the penalty!! Corrupted UEFA!!!
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea no7 is absolutely useless
XVRlNJxakqA,Goalies off their line every kick 🤦🏻‍♂️
XVRlNJxakqA,"xG of James estimated: 5% 
xG of Penalty estimated: 70% 
Yes. There might be some touch on her leg. But do we really want that worth of an almost sure goal?
VAR has solve some problems. But it has created other ones in exchange."
XVRlNJxakqA,Heart break
XVRlNJxakqA,"Congratulations Ladies best Chelsea game to watch all year,Emma how about coaching the men's team as well 😊"
XVRlNJxakqA,Soft PK to call.. but congratulations on beating the champs
XVRlNJxakqA,I wish they showed the last penalty from down the end line. It looked suspiciously like the keeper’s feet were off the line but from our angle you can’t tell.
XVRlNJxakqA,"chelsea  keeper one the 2 penalties was fault  , she move forward of the line amazing the referee didn't call"
XVRlNJxakqA,Come on Chelsea!!
XVRlNJxakqA,"The penalty came from a fall in terrupting his own leg.
 Referees look at var why
 I now watch more women's football than mens football James dived clearly although cheering for James in the England nation team"
XVRlNJxakqA,Why was there no players on the edge of the box when the penalty was taken at the end of extra time ?
XVRlNJxakqA,My only wish is we have full squad fit against Barca.
XVRlNJxakqA,If that was a penalty then every game would be filled with penalties
XVRlNJxakqA,what a frigging game
XVRlNJxakqA,i thought keepers were supposed to stay on their line
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea Capt needs to defend well against Barca or else they'll be thrashed
XVRlNJxakqA,Are we gonna see a all London Final?
XVRlNJxakqA,How was that a penalty Lyon was robbed
XVRlNJxakqA,"That was a very soft penalty and a really poor and costly decision by the referee. Believe it or not, contact IS allowed in football. 🙄"
XVRlNJxakqA,"so you clip your own leg, fall over and the ref gives a penalty-worse then the mens game-cheating and diving"
XVRlNJxakqA,Up up the Blues 💪🏾💙💙💙
XVRlNJxakqA,Not being funny but my 14 year old nephew could of saved that second lyon goal 🙈
XVRlNJxakqA,Up the Chels!!
XVRlNJxakqA,That was never a penalty James tripped herself up
XVRlNJxakqA,Leo deserved win
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea Chelsea Chelsea 💙💙💙
XVRlNJxakqA,"Erikson and Kaloubaly have similar playing styles in terms of errors, miss kicks and wrong decision wise 😂 Todd should buy Maria Leon from Barca 😊 with those kind of errors, we're lucky to win . Sam Kerr should stop wasting 1v1 chances ; composer is required to burry those chances"
XVRlNJxakqA,I stopped watching after Lyons second goal. went back and it was penalty shootout and I couldn't believe it. What happened in 15min🤔I'm proud of my ladies💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
XVRlNJxakqA,Emma Hayes should replace potter
XVRlNJxakqA,That wasn't even a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,Stamford Bridge is one special place 😢
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea goal keeper is the man of the match 😍
XVRlNJxakqA,What a game. I dont usually watch womens footy but i will now. Wow.
XVRlNJxakqA,I thought penalty controversy only happened in male football. 😁 Coz that was nowhere a penalty.
XVRlNJxakqA,The James siblings☀☀🌟
XVRlNJxakqA,That Lyon defender is dumb. No need to touch james
XVRlNJxakqA,Why 120 min??
XVRlNJxakqA,Intensive game. What a game from the ladies.
XVRlNJxakqA,Never a pen
XVRlNJxakqA,"Ashamed. Imaginary penalty, Lyon was robbed by arbitration. What is VAR for?"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Chelsea has to play at Aston Villa Sunday.
They'll be worn out and sore.

Aston Villa isn't going to win a top 3 spot this season but they're going to wreck some dreams."
XVRlNJxakqA,That last minute penalty was definitely not a pen 😂😂😂
XVRlNJxakqA,"Never a penalty, she felt some contact then put her foot back to be clipped. Clever, but depressing."
XVRlNJxakqA,That is bad refereeing
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James is world Class. Lauren James is world Class. Lauren James is world Class. Lauren James is world Class.
XVRlNJxakqA,what a game
XVRlNJxakqA,wait can someone explain why the players werent surrounding the box for mjelde's penalty in extra time
XVRlNJxakqA,"Well done ladies, you make you’re own luck but class is class."
XVRlNJxakqA,"To be fair, that was no way a penalty!! 
According to this ref, any sort of touch is foul"
XVRlNJxakqA,"The Lionesses legacy continues with two English teams into the last four of the Champions League. Congratulations Chelsea. It was a 12 round chess match where both team frustrated each other. Fantastic to see Potter, James and a few others from the men’s team supporting their teammates. Hope Leupolz is ok."
XVRlNJxakqA,It’s an inescapable fact that the Chelsea player dived for the penalty. Even the most biased supporter sees that.
XVRlNJxakqA,Scandalous…how far off her line is the Chelsea keeper on these penalties…as for Lauren James what a diving cheat…shame on you.
XVRlNJxakqA,Congratulations
XVRlNJxakqA,"Well done Chelsea Women amazing stuff but terribly edited highlights. Chopping off commentary all over the place , poor cross fades and Lyon Women’s second penalty is missing. So confusing to watch. Come on Dazn, you’re better than this"
XVRlNJxakqA,"NEVER A PENALTY-NEVER. I don't think there was even any contact but if there was, the Chelsea striker has been waiting for a TINY touch & cheated via diving-pathetic. STOP WATCHING THE MEN'S GAME GIRLS!!! The commentators all forget it is a contact sport & contact is allowed in the rules of the game."
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon missed a lot of chances
XVRlNJxakqA,This penalty a shame
XVRlNJxakqA,"Commentator, you can be excited you know you've just witnessed a 128th minute equaliser in a champions league quarter final and she sounds like she's just watched her cat die"
XVRlNJxakqA,Y the penalty when it’s 2:1
XVRlNJxakqA,"It wasn't a lucky day for Erickssen, our skipper"
XVRlNJxakqA,The chelsea Keeper for women is better than Kepa in Penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,That wasn’t a penalty but congrats to chelsea 👏🏿
XVRlNJxakqA,the women football is like when you start master league and all your players run slower and shoot like they pass...
XVRlNJxakqA,How is no one talking about Lauren James? Such a great player! what a player?
XVRlNJxakqA,How was that a pen 😂
XVRlNJxakqA,Crazy UCL night at the bridge what do you expect 🎉
XVRlNJxakqA,James was unplayable 💥💥
XVRlNJxakqA,"How was that penalty given 😂😂, sooooo soft."
XVRlNJxakqA,"We kinda played bad ngl
I expect more from eriksson"
XVRlNJxakqA,There's no penalty at the end of the game. What a robbery...
XVRlNJxakqA,Question is: who cares?
XVRlNJxakqA,"ok, fair play to chelsea for getting through but i thought they left too many gaps in midfield & could have been destroyed only for Lyon were off their game, they will be annihilated by Barcelona if they do that in semis, plus the Lyon first penno miss should have been retaken as the keeper came way off her line, but look its done now so they have to focus on the nxt game"
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm glad Chelsea got through but with both Chelsea saves it did look like the keeper was off her line. I didn't see the penalties live, just this footage."
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm a Chelsea fan and I love the women team so much as they have been the joy of Chelsea fans this season. That being said, that was not a penalty. And if they don't play better, Barcelona women will blow them away...........the penalty take Mjelde was cool as ice"
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon deserved to win but it was a foolish challenge by Becho and it cost them dearly...  And even Lyon would've struggled against Barcelona in the semi's.  Chelsea have even less of a chance but an upset is always possible.
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren and Reece are TRUE jems of this club... even mason mount... proper chels
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'll admit that I stopped watching at the 119th minute, what little faith I have! Well-done you superb Chelsea ladies!"
XVRlNJxakqA,I'm happy for our keeper's input during the shootouts but not during the open-play.
XVRlNJxakqA,"Never a pen tbh, nevertheless Barça is waiting 😈"
XVRlNJxakqA,The best club 🙇💁🦁💙
XVRlNJxakqA,Never a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James is special. What a player 💯💯🔥🔥
XVRlNJxakqA,That was no penalty...
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm sorry but Erikson makes me nervous. She doesn't convince me one bit. I can't believe she's the captain. She makes so many mistakes. That first goal of Lyon, she was ball watching and doesn't mark the 1st post. Second Lyon goal was also her fault. She failed to position herself well to be able to clear the ball. I wish Bright will be back for the semis. Erikson is too raw for me, I'm sorry. Chelsea should consider getting another Buchanan to back Bright."
XVRlNJxakqA,I fall in  love we this Chelsea women's
XVRlNJxakqA,But how was that a pen ??
XVRlNJxakqA,great game on both team
XVRlNJxakqA,"Ericsson tried to bottle it up for Chelsea,Bright was missed,Lauren James is our best player this season,Mjelda and Carter all had a wonderful night,Berger is the hero of the night"
XVRlNJxakqA,shame on Chelsea with an imagineray penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,"Chelsea keeper came off her line before Lyon players struck the ball for both penalties saved at the end, should have been retaken."
XVRlNJxakqA,"What the Men can do, the Women can do better"
XVRlNJxakqA,How the tables turn at the last minute. Holding the ball inside the penalty area and hoping someone fouls you can change a whole game
XVRlNJxakqA,I was crying 😭…. But happy
XVRlNJxakqA,Ericsson almost did 2 big mistakes on both legs 😅😅😅
XVRlNJxakqA,"Berger, Frohms, Grohs, and in the last years Schult, Angerer, Rottenberg... Germany has the greatest GK on earth without any doubt!"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea is massive! 🔵
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea with ANOTHER robbery💀
XVRlNJxakqA,James has a future in acting... Chelsea has the most players who take the best penalty kicks!
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea fan but that was no penalty. She should be auditioning in Hollywood.
XVRlNJxakqA,First penalty wasn´t correct  !!!
XVRlNJxakqA,That soft penalty robbery really 😂😂
XVRlNJxakqA,Can't wait for the World Cup...watching how great all these players are so far....its awesome!
XVRlNJxakqA,"But Chelsea need to work on defence , everything is okay"
XVRlNJxakqA,She's gonna win ballodor if she plays like this and by the help of her teammates
XVRlNJxakqA,Same old Chelsea always cheating
XVRlNJxakqA,wasn't a penalty though
XVRlNJxakqA,That's not a penalty. And the Chelsea keeper goes out of the line. It's should have been a retake
XVRlNJxakqA,And Where is The penalty?
XVRlNJxakqA,Wow...... infact I gave up on the ladies and stopped watching when the second goal went in. I woke up only this morning seeing a pop up on my phone about the result. Great win from my Blue Ladies.... well done. 💙👌💙
XVRlNJxakqA,"Love this channel..
Your highlights are always clear"
XVRlNJxakqA,Do they not check the keeper coming off the line for penalties in the woman’s game?
XVRlNJxakqA,The last penalty rule violation by Berger..So Chelsea didn't deserve.
XVRlNJxakqA,Nobody talking about the terrible penalty decision that ruined the whole tie?
XVRlNJxakqA,We’ve all Withness something last night😂😂😂
XVRlNJxakqA,"Thanks for showing these great games freely, DAZN."
XVRlNJxakqA,Wmns champion league is getting better and better
XVRlNJxakqA,"a game where defences & midfield ruled, cuthbert & Van da donk, Buccanan & Renard were all brilliant"
XVRlNJxakqA,"I was literally so sad in in last 2 mins had no hope but then Lauren got clipped. VAR you know what that means, pen. I WAS SCARED for my life. The way we scored that pen was cool. World class. And the fact that we won on penalties, I can call this best game of tournament so far. I was delighted"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Lauren will get better and better, shes a beast wallahi ✅✅✅"
XVRlNJxakqA,That is no where near a penalty haha shocking decision absolutely
XVRlNJxakqA,"Also the last Lyon s penalty, Chelsea goalkeeper left her line early ........."
XVRlNJxakqA,At this point we need to transfer some of these women to the men's team... 💙💙💙LOVE THE SPIRIT..COYB
XVRlNJxakqA,That penalty in xtra time isnt a penalty tho
XVRlNJxakqA,I am happy there are fans supporting them in this game. Congratulations to both sides for having amazing fans. Entertaining game had us on the edge of our seat. The late drama is just typical champions league spirit 😊. Nice to see this kind of scene in women's game.
XVRlNJxakqA,The celebrating for lyons first goal😂😂😂
XVRlNJxakqA,"The last minute , are you sure penalty for Chelsea ? 
I think is not penalty 😂"
XVRlNJxakqA,samm kerr missing chances
XVRlNJxakqA,Never a penalty though
XVRlNJxakqA,No penalty lol
XVRlNJxakqA,"Lauren James is world class, world class!"
XVRlNJxakqA,Ucl at stamford bridge just hits different 💙
XVRlNJxakqA,What a rediculous penalty decision in minute 120. The referees seem to like Chelsea in international games💸
XVRlNJxakqA,Never a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea will be destroyed by Barcelona 22 April 😎
XVRlNJxakqA,Cuthbert is the N'golo Kante of the ladies team. She was a monster in that midfield
XVRlNJxakqA,"Chelsea got a nice present with that 90+2 ""penalty""..."
XVRlNJxakqA,The Chelsea  captain is the weak link in the defence I have watched many matches were she gives away silly balls that lead to goal......
XVRlNJxakqA,"That penalty by Mjelde was on another level compared to the last few penalties taken by havertz. She was so calm and composed. Havertz on the other side, misses his first penalty after beoming the main penalty taker since jorghinos departure. Luckily he got to retake it."
XVRlNJxakqA,Don't goallies have to stay on their line until pens are taken in the women's game?
XVRlNJxakqA,Who is that Chelsea's number 16?   Worst player on the pitch. What a disaster.
XVRlNJxakqA,Best match in the competition so far. Intensity and quality all round.
XVRlNJxakqA,"I that Barcelona were the once who is paying ref, but I was wrong, how is that a penalty?🤣😂"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea captain is useless
XVRlNJxakqA,I turned it off at 2 minutes into injury time extra time and only just found out that they did give that penalty.
XVRlNJxakqA,WHAT A GAME! PROUD OF THE BLUES
XVRlNJxakqA,Fkin VAR saved us tbh
XVRlNJxakqA,"no penalty for me, James were searching the contact, see how the left leg bends to the right to the defender...."
XVRlNJxakqA,This James's family was born for footfall❤
XVRlNJxakqA,Sam kerr is a magic for chelsea
XVRlNJxakqA,i dont like that 120min var decision to give a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,"So much drama at the end of this match! And heartbreaking to see Horan crying after the penalty save. 
May the best teams get through to the final!"
XVRlNJxakqA,Erikson making such huge mistakes twice  and costing the team 😢
XVRlNJxakqA,"😂😂😂 whats, pinalty???"
XVRlNJxakqA,"If we can overcome Barca, we will win it."
XVRlNJxakqA,So proud of Chelsea tonight never say die attitude .come on..
XVRlNJxakqA,"LJ is an absolute baller
Come on Chelsea"
XVRlNJxakqA,1st save from Chelsea....goalkeeper position isn't ok..it's not a goal..
XVRlNJxakqA,Penalty?
XVRlNJxakqA,What a match😮
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren is such a baller man. Just like her brother Reecey
XVRlNJxakqA,its not penalty come on bro🤣
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm a chelsea fans , it wasn't a penalty for really"
XVRlNJxakqA,Is this football? This is comedy. James was the only person on the pitch coming close to football.
XVRlNJxakqA,I'm just here for AKB's knee slide celebration
XVRlNJxakqA,"Barcelona about to win this year, great Job by Chelsea"
XVRlNJxakqA,"with lyon out, barcelona most likely will win it or i should say strong favourites"
XVRlNJxakqA,What a moment! what a match! COYB Great job ladies.
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon were robbed that was never a pen
XVRlNJxakqA,"This is far better exciting,tense and interesting than watching the men's  chelsea team"
XVRlNJxakqA,The women’s Chelsea should trade places with the masculine team !
XVRlNJxakqA,"This is so unfair, the goalkeeper must remain with both of her feets on the goal line at the time of execution of the penalty, thing that she didn't , I'm not fan of any of this teams but gotta say"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Disappointing mistake by the Lyon player in the box, she didn't need to go for a tackle as another Lyon defender (Carpenter I think) had it covered, there would've been a corner kick at best"
XVRlNJxakqA,If it was milli bright in place of ericksson we won't even concede those two goals
XVRlNJxakqA,That wasn't a penalty. VAR just wants Chelsea to win.
XVRlNJxakqA,Boehly pays VAR
XVRlNJxakqA,Cool to see Lauren James is also doing well.
XVRlNJxakqA,that gk celebration at the end lol
XVRlNJxakqA,Emma must do something with those 2 Centre Back. A lot of mistakes on defense. Whatta game! My heart's almost stop beating.
XVRlNJxakqA,This is CHELSEA! We will go against the 2 most important teams in Spain (men and women)
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea got outplayed over the two legs. But the best team doesn't always win. *shrug*
XVRlNJxakqA,"What a Game
 Between Che vs OLy 😱🔥🔥🔥"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea 💙
XVRlNJxakqA,That's the lightest pen i seen i a while.
XVRlNJxakqA,The Chelsea keeper is actually better than kepa
XVRlNJxakqA,ann-katrin berger. incredible saves on that penalty shootout. well deserved Chelsea 👏
XVRlNJxakqA,"I like Chelsea, but Chelsea women did not deserve to go through."
XVRlNJxakqA,How come the goalkeeper was allowed to step out of the line before the kick was taken. The saves would have been retaken.
XVRlNJxakqA,"Vamos Barca 
Barca will win the uwcl 🎉"
XVRlNJxakqA,How can Laura James tripping herself be a penalty. There was no contact with her by the lyon player. Lyon have been robbed big time. The ref and VAR needs medicine for thier glaucoma. 😡😡
XVRlNJxakqA,Fair play to chelsea but that was a soft penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea ❤❤❤❤❤💪
XVRlNJxakqA,So English goalkeepers are allowed to leave the line before the penalty is kicked. I didn't know about this specific rule.
XVRlNJxakqA,VAR corruption at its best
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm so glad Lyon is out xD. But to be fair... in the PK shootout, Chelsea's goal keeper got in front of the goal line way before the kicker take the shot, both penalties should have been repeated in today's rules."
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon won many times let the rest pls 😂😂😂
XVRlNJxakqA,DIDNT KNOW THE CHELSEA OWNER OLD TODD IS ALSO THE WOMANS MANAGER LOL
XVRlNJxakqA,Magdalena Erikson destroyer the game
XVRlNJxakqA,7:53 Did she not step out of line too early??
XVRlNJxakqA,Erikson time at the Bridge is over
XVRlNJxakqA,This game was rigged this is robbery to Lyon
XVRlNJxakqA,playing bunch of sissies
XVRlNJxakqA,They are going to need a lot more than VAR cheat code against Barcelona Femeni thou.. Infact they shud just let the Male team play the semis 😂😂
XVRlNJxakqA,"LYON WAS ROBBED!!! THAT'S NOT A PENALTY IN A THOUSAND LIFETIMES....
MAFIAAAAAAA"
XVRlNJxakqA,UP THE CHELS! COYB
XVRlNJxakqA,"Chelsea fc ladies was never really in the match in the second half and extra time until that penalty,it was just like a miracle for Chelsea to get that penalty out of nothing."
XVRlNJxakqA,I'm glad both french teams we're defeated.
XVRlNJxakqA,bruh what a game.
XVRlNJxakqA,Erickson was really poor
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon comfortably the better side. Barca will batter Chelsea in the SF.
XVRlNJxakqA,Why weren’t the rest of the players around the box for the penalty in the last min?
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren and Reece definitely trained a lot together growing up. They mirror each other in style
XVRlNJxakqA,Let’s go chelsea
XVRlNJxakqA,Poor play by womens😅😅😅
XVRlNJxakqA,"Keeper off her line for every pen, how could that not be looked at? Makes no sense"
XVRlNJxakqA,That was not a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,No way that’s a pen💀💀
XVRlNJxakqA,The robbery of the century at Stamford Bridge. The referee saw the penalty when they gave her the money. Corrupt Chelsea buying referees.
XVRlNJxakqA,I stopped watching the game with less than 2 mins to end extra time only to later find on the Chelsea women's page on Instagram that Chelsea were through to the semis. Imagine my shock and dumbfounded face
XVRlNJxakqA,"On penalties, the Chelsea goalkeeper takes the lead before kick-off. Why wasn't that sanctioned?"
XVRlNJxakqA,The referee is a 🤡Chelsea 💩💩💩🤮🤮🤮
XVRlNJxakqA,That wasn’t a pen. James dived 😂
XVRlNJxakqA,Lets. Do this
XVRlNJxakqA,She tripped on her own leg.
XVRlNJxakqA,Gowan the blues 💙
XVRlNJxakqA,An absolute ridiculous penalty. Cheating in women's football too?
XVRlNJxakqA,"My favorite color . BLue is on the top.of Champion leauge. Blue lion of London. Great Blues, great roar.❤"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Only Chelsea women team care about the club. Thats all I need to know. 
Attitude, passion, mentality, desire. 
Nobody cares about the men's team"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea's captain is not so fantastic tonight.
XVRlNJxakqA,"Happy Chelsea won, but Eriksson seems to be getting worse as the games go on this year. Just one bad decision after another."
XVRlNJxakqA,An Instant classic
XVRlNJxakqA,Is it a penalty that simulation?????? 🤔🤔🤔🤔 I think no!
XVRlNJxakqA,Couldn’t believe it and if we can beat Lyon Women than we can do anything while beating PSG Women twice in the group stage let’s go blues
XVRlNJxakqA,The girls showing how its done. Now its up to the men´s team vs. real to replicate it.
XVRlNJxakqA,"That was a ridiculous, absurd penalty call on Lyon in the last minute of the match. VAR stole the match from the French team. That was in no way a penalty---beyond soft. Disgraceful call. Chelsea did not deserve to win that match."
XVRlNJxakqA,The penalty is a joke ! Scandalous
XVRlNJxakqA,"BLATANT CHEATING 
  We all know"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Women PremierLrague best league in Europe, Barcellona is the strongest team, but nobody have 4 teams Chelsea,Arsenal,United,City from quarterfinals/semifinals of WUCL"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Right now, Iam so proud of the club #upthechels #ChelseaFC #championsofeurope"
XVRlNJxakqA,The penalty wasn't a penalty....as usual the Brits cheat...
XVRlNJxakqA,Yes chelsea. Come on you blues!!!! 🎉
XVRlNJxakqA,I would never have believed it if someone told me in 2023 I’d be supporting the women’s CHELS more than the men’s
XVRlNJxakqA,"Highway robbery, one of the softest penalties ever. A great injustice has been done to Lyon!!"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea need to be investigated for paying the VAR people and the ref Lauren trips up on her own leg and it wasn't a clear and obvious error
XVRlNJxakqA,Happy for Women football
XVRlNJxakqA,Erikson could've done better to prevent those two goals. She has been a bit of a liability as of late
XVRlNJxakqA,That was not a penalty what a awful decision
XVRlNJxakqA,I understand the significance and I understand that players are human and people too but I was surprised that horan cried at the end knowing how many big tournaments she’s been in and how experienced she is
XVRlNJxakqA,THAT penalty is a SHAME 😡😡
XVRlNJxakqA,"Bye bye olympique de madrid, thx Chelsea, this champions going to barcelona 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽"
XVRlNJxakqA,How are people saying that’s not a penalty? She makes contact with James’ leg which then makes her go down. Literally a stone wall penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,What a save that is to win it 🙏🏼
XVRlNJxakqA,What an incredible game
XVRlNJxakqA,"Shameful refereeing decisions - no penalty for Chelsea in e.t., and both saves on the penalties shot out must be retaken because the Chelsea goalkeeper moves from the line before the shot."
XVRlNJxakqA,That was not penalty 😂
XVRlNJxakqA,How can the officials not see that the Chelsea keeper is a yard off her line when the penalty kicks are taken? Admittedly she has to go the right way to be in a position to make the save but it makes a complete mockery of the penalty shootout.
XVRlNJxakqA,Congratulations to the whole Chelsea fan
XVRlNJxakqA,"That's not a penalty for every touch, the referee was right. VAR is just making it worse."
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon was robbed. Chelsea are cheaters. I hope they get knocked out of the tournament.
XVRlNJxakqA,How was that a pen
XVRlNJxakqA,"120+2mins and the boys are losing, will they ever make it through just like the girls with? with Harry Potter in charge ?????😊"
XVRlNJxakqA,Is this the sister of chelseas James?
XVRlNJxakqA,Why didn't you show all of the penalties?
XVRlNJxakqA,Great game blues
XVRlNJxakqA,They fought well...deserved it ✌🏾
XVRlNJxakqA,They are better penalty taker than the mens team 👏🏼
XVRlNJxakqA,Brilliant penalty save to win it
XVRlNJxakqA,Leupolz  take care  ❤💪🏻 my best wishes
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James will surely bounce back from the missed penalty and become even more dominant.
XVRlNJxakqA,I don’t agree with the penalty decision but what a finish 🤩
XVRlNJxakqA,No pen reff fvkin terrible
XVRlNJxakqA,Well done Chelsea !
XVRlNJxakqA,My girls will never let me down! I am so proud!
XVRlNJxakqA,What a match 💙🤍🔥
XVRlNJxakqA,What a game!! I had to say I didn't expect it!!
XVRlNJxakqA,We don’t need the VAR 🤷🏻‍♂️
XVRlNJxakqA,This is the golden age for women’s football in England for certain for clubs and country
XVRlNJxakqA,Came back to this and I want to say Lauren James is a brilliant player
XVRlNJxakqA,March 28 im here in emma hayes we trust
XVRlNJxakqA,"The person with the highest score in this match is Danielle Van de Donk.
A completely different game from the first half, Lyon needs to understand the value of the bright Dutch star. Chelsea players didn't even have the desired passes with DvD's smart play and high pressing!"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Its not penalty.
Anyway, congrats chelsea"
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren gameplay like Reece 💙
XVRlNJxakqA,The Best team lose
XVRlNJxakqA,😂😂😂😂😂😂 they are so funny
XVRlNJxakqA,Nice extended highlights ❤❤❤❤
XVRlNJxakqA,Anybody help me with the name of the comentator please
XVRlNJxakqA,"But honestly, was this really the best thumbnail pic you could think of for this clip?! I mean, just look at that hand placement..."
XVRlNJxakqA,"The Chelsea goalkeeper illegally overtakes in the 2 penalties she saved. I don't know if in the female the rule in penalties is the same as in the male. The referee was very weak, she didn't see the overtaking, she didn't see the penalty at minute 120, they had to warn her about the var and the backhand that they gave Melanie Leupolz who had to leave due to the endless bleeding she had from her nose didn't see it either."
XVRlNJxakqA,Am a Chelsea fan but that first assist and goal from Lyon ladies was sweet.
XVRlNJxakqA,Bravo....am happy for my club
XVRlNJxakqA,"The one that took the penalty, then stepped up first in the shootout has massive balls under pressure"
XVRlNJxakqA,"No penalty, no way thats a penalty, ex ref."
XVRlNJxakqA,Out make team will also knockout the make champions league holders Real Madrid
XVRlNJxakqA,Jessie Fleming stepping up for a PK for Chelsea ..... reminded me instantly of the Japan Summer Olympics. (Does she ever miss a PK?)
XVRlNJxakqA,"Nice saves, those goalkeepers are top notch in the women's league"
XVRlNJxakqA,Maybe the men can take a bit from this.
XVRlNJxakqA,All the people that watched the match but stopped at 120 mins should be watching the replay after every match. Imagine that it was after you left watching that they won.
XVRlNJxakqA,It was dramatic match.
XVRlNJxakqA,I love Chelsea from Thailand
XVRlNJxakqA,For me it's the Drogba run buy the goal keeper😅🥇🏆💯💪🇯🇲🙌🏿🙂
XVRlNJxakqA,"All the males you see here,we're forced to come by their girlfriends"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Real Madrid be like: nah Lyon Feminin is too weak, let us teach Chelsea a lesson."
XVRlNJxakqA,That's not a penalty for Chelsea woman.
XVRlNJxakqA,"As usual . Anyone plays against a British team and referees begin whistling as referees to Barcelona in la Liga. Only time is was right was the final of 66 . But after everything divided is always on the bit team (as if Europe is  a colony of UK and they have to have always the benefit. I'm not a fan o Lyon or Chelsea . ""se got clicked"" and you are blind .  There are a lot of games where brit players hit even harder and you guys ignore it or play nothing happend."
XVRlNJxakqA,"Eriksson is a liability in that defence.

I can't wait for Millie Bright to be back, so she's dropped to the bench."
XVRlNJxakqA,why were lyon so mad about the pk>? what were they complaining about>?
XVRlNJxakqA,"Lots of comments about the last-gasp penalty for Chelsea. Of course there is contact but James leans into her opponent to create it. The defender does not make a tackle at all, she just ""jockeys"". Not a penalty in my view. Chelsea so, so lucky."
XVRlNJxakqA,missed the clip of leupolz getting her head bashed in this game was literally war out there it had everything
XVRlNJxakqA,YNWA ..well done Chelsea..
XVRlNJxakqA,I am a Chelsea fan and that wasn't a penalty. She kicked herself.
XVRlNJxakqA,Very generous penalty! Lyon played better and deserved to win
XVRlNJxakqA,"Women Football Grown like wow

What a game KTBFFH 💙💙💙"
XVRlNJxakqA,I thought Lyon would have gone through with away goals
XVRlNJxakqA,When did Chelsea score their second goal?
XVRlNJxakqA,Did anyone come here jus to see Melanie Leupolz injury…I mean I really don’t see why another reason why to… women’s football hella boring 🥱
XVRlNJxakqA,"Jessie Fleming also scored a Penalty, not shown... 🤔"
XVRlNJxakqA,Joke of a penalty lol
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea penalty isn't deserve I think for me as Chelsea fans but this kind of case type is usually happen at least we've going to semi finals 😁
XVRlNJxakqA,What a game!!!!
XVRlNJxakqA,Clear and obvious error?
XVRlNJxakqA,How is that a pen 😂. Getting level with the mens game I guess with shocking VAR calls
XVRlNJxakqA,"That Chelsea lady knows how to take a penalty. Unlike Neymar and other ""experts""."
XVRlNJxakqA,How is this a penalty?
XVRlNJxakqA,Kepa definitely trained Berger on penalties
XVRlNJxakqA,Hey
XVRlNJxakqA,"Soft one, but she was clipped"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea 🔵
XVRlNJxakqA,Superb by Chelsea
XVRlNJxakqA,Best womens match I’ve seen so far by far
XVRlNJxakqA,So women goalkeepers are allowed to come off their line in penalties but men aren’t? Is that a rule now is it?
XVRlNJxakqA,Seriously poor quality
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James and his brother Reece are amazing players
XVRlNJxakqA,Congratulations our Chelsea ladies
XVRlNJxakqA,Hope the boys can do it
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James cheated at the end to get that penalty !!!!  OL LYON did the job !
XVRlNJxakqA,That was nice to watch #CFC
XVRlNJxakqA,Great game! Turn down the Vol on the commentator!!
XVRlNJxakqA,Recce James must teach her sister how to take spots
XVRlNJxakqA,"When you can't win, you cheat, nicely done James, what a player, what a diver ! 🤣"
XVRlNJxakqA,Incredible game but Chelsea is lucky. Well done but Barcelona will crush them next round. 0 chance to get the final. Chelsea is an old version of kick & rush.
XVRlNJxakqA,It's an outrage  !
XVRlNJxakqA,Was never a penalty. Referees seem to give English teams penalties all the time now. Its become very predictable
XVRlNJxakqA,Surely each save was off the line? Chelsea fan here btw but the last pen was 6yr box 😂
XVRlNJxakqA,"Vamos Barca , thank you Chelsea for KO the French champ , who’s always a hurdle for Barca in UCL .My vote goes to Barca to win UCL.Chelsea deserves it today .Superb Game ."
XVRlNJxakqA,That’s not a pen!!!
XVRlNJxakqA,That's not penalty!.. Lyon was robbed!
XVRlNJxakqA,I love Lauren James but that was not really a Penalty. She just threw herself down ro get a Penalty. The first Penalty for Lyon was supposed to be retaken because The Chelsea Goalkeeper came out of her line before the Penalty was Kicked. Why not use the same rules in Women's Soccer football as they are used in Men's?
XVRlNJxakqA,"Well done, but the case for Equal pay, I don't think so if this is the top quality football on show, then there is a very long way to go in Quality. But very well done in getting to the semi-finals Ladies."
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James really need to work on her shooting accuracy
XVRlNJxakqA,Great fight and determination! Well done Chelsea Ladies !
XVRlNJxakqA,"Despite the qualified Chelsea hardly spring passes together last night 
And I was so annoyed...
Congratulations to them though"
XVRlNJxakqA,My Queens!
XVRlNJxakqA,That was not the penalty!! Corrupted UEFA!!!
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea no7 is absolutely useless
XVRlNJxakqA,Goalies off their line every kick 🤦🏻‍♂️
XVRlNJxakqA,"xG of James estimated: 5% 
xG of Penalty estimated: 70% 
Yes. There might be some touch on her leg. But do we really want that worth of an almost sure goal?
VAR has solve some problems. But it has created other ones in exchange."
XVRlNJxakqA,Heart break
XVRlNJxakqA,"Congratulations Ladies best Chelsea game to watch all year,Emma how about coaching the men's team as well 😊"
XVRlNJxakqA,Soft PK to call.. but congratulations on beating the champs
XVRlNJxakqA,I wish they showed the last penalty from down the end line. It looked suspiciously like the keeper’s feet were off the line but from our angle you can’t tell.
XVRlNJxakqA,"chelsea  keeper one the 2 penalties was fault  , she move forward of the line amazing the referee didn't call"
XVRlNJxakqA,Come on Chelsea!!
XVRlNJxakqA,"The penalty came from a fall in terrupting his own leg.
 Referees look at var why
 I now watch more women's football than mens football James dived clearly although cheering for James in the England nation team"
XVRlNJxakqA,Why was there no players on the edge of the box when the penalty was taken at the end of extra time ?
XVRlNJxakqA,My only wish is we have full squad fit against Barca.
XVRlNJxakqA,If that was a penalty then every game would be filled with penalties
XVRlNJxakqA,what a frigging game
XVRlNJxakqA,i thought keepers were supposed to stay on their line
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea Capt needs to defend well against Barca or else they'll be thrashed
XVRlNJxakqA,Are we gonna see a all London Final?
XVRlNJxakqA,How was that a penalty Lyon was robbed
XVRlNJxakqA,"That was a very soft penalty and a really poor and costly decision by the referee. Believe it or not, contact IS allowed in football. 🙄"
XVRlNJxakqA,"so you clip your own leg, fall over and the ref gives a penalty-worse then the mens game-cheating and diving"
XVRlNJxakqA,Up up the Blues 💪🏾💙💙💙
XVRlNJxakqA,Not being funny but my 14 year old nephew could of saved that second lyon goal 🙈
XVRlNJxakqA,Up the Chels!!
XVRlNJxakqA,That was never a penalty James tripped herself up
XVRlNJxakqA,Leo deserved win
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea Chelsea Chelsea 💙💙💙
XVRlNJxakqA,"Erikson and Kaloubaly have similar playing styles in terms of errors, miss kicks and wrong decision wise 😂 Todd should buy Maria Leon from Barca 😊 with those kind of errors, we're lucky to win . Sam Kerr should stop wasting 1v1 chances ; composer is required to burry those chances"
XVRlNJxakqA,I stopped watching after Lyons second goal. went back and it was penalty shootout and I couldn't believe it. What happened in 15min🤔I'm proud of my ladies💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
XVRlNJxakqA,Emma Hayes should replace potter
XVRlNJxakqA,That wasn't even a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,Stamford Bridge is one special place 😢
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea goal keeper is the man of the match 😍
XVRlNJxakqA,What a game. I dont usually watch womens footy but i will now. Wow.
XVRlNJxakqA,I thought penalty controversy only happened in male football. 😁 Coz that was nowhere a penalty.
XVRlNJxakqA,The James siblings☀☀🌟
XVRlNJxakqA,That Lyon defender is dumb. No need to touch james
XVRlNJxakqA,Why 120 min??
XVRlNJxakqA,Intensive game. What a game from the ladies.
XVRlNJxakqA,Never a pen
XVRlNJxakqA,"Ashamed. Imaginary penalty, Lyon was robbed by arbitration. What is VAR for?"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Chelsea has to play at Aston Villa Sunday.
They'll be worn out and sore.

Aston Villa isn't going to win a top 3 spot this season but they're going to wreck some dreams."
XVRlNJxakqA,That last minute penalty was definitely not a pen 😂😂😂
XVRlNJxakqA,"Never a penalty, she felt some contact then put her foot back to be clipped. Clever, but depressing."
XVRlNJxakqA,That is bad refereeing
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James is world Class. Lauren James is world Class. Lauren James is world Class. Lauren James is world Class.
XVRlNJxakqA,what a game
XVRlNJxakqA,wait can someone explain why the players werent surrounding the box for mjelde's penalty in extra time
XVRlNJxakqA,"Well done ladies, you make you’re own luck but class is class."
XVRlNJxakqA,"To be fair, that was no way a penalty!! 
According to this ref, any sort of touch is foul"
XVRlNJxakqA,"The Lionesses legacy continues with two English teams into the last four of the Champions League. Congratulations Chelsea. It was a 12 round chess match where both team frustrated each other. Fantastic to see Potter, James and a few others from the men’s team supporting their teammates. Hope Leupolz is ok."
XVRlNJxakqA,It’s an inescapable fact that the Chelsea player dived for the penalty. Even the most biased supporter sees that.
XVRlNJxakqA,Scandalous…how far off her line is the Chelsea keeper on these penalties…as for Lauren James what a diving cheat…shame on you.
XVRlNJxakqA,"Well done Chelsea Women amazing stuff but terribly edited highlights. Chopping off commentary all over the place , poor cross fades and Lyon Women’s second penalty is missing. So confusing to watch. Come on Dazn, you’re better than this"
XVRlNJxakqA,"NEVER A PENALTY-NEVER. I don't think there was even any contact but if there was, the Chelsea striker has been waiting for a TINY touch & cheated via diving-pathetic. STOP WATCHING THE MEN'S GAME GIRLS!!! The commentators all forget it is a contact sport & contact is allowed in the rules of the game."
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon missed a lot of chances
XVRlNJxakqA,This penalty a shame
XVRlNJxakqA,"Commentator, you can be excited you know you've just witnessed a 128th minute equaliser in a champions league quarter final and she sounds like she's just watched her cat die"
XVRlNJxakqA,Y the penalty when it’s 2:1
XVRlNJxakqA,"It wasn't a lucky day for Erickssen, our skipper"
XVRlNJxakqA,The chelsea Keeper for women is better than Kepa in Penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,That wasn’t a penalty but congrats to chelsea 👏🏿
XVRlNJxakqA,the women football is like when you start master league and all your players run slower and shoot like they pass...
XVRlNJxakqA,How is no one talking about Lauren James? Such a great player! what a player?
XVRlNJxakqA,How was that a pen 😂
XVRlNJxakqA,Crazy UCL night at the bridge what do you expect 🎉
XVRlNJxakqA,James was unplayable 💥💥
XVRlNJxakqA,"How was that penalty given 😂😂, sooooo soft."
XVRlNJxakqA,"We kinda played bad ngl
I expect more from eriksson"
XVRlNJxakqA,There's no penalty at the end of the game. What a robbery...
XVRlNJxakqA,Question is: who cares?
XVRlNJxakqA,"ok, fair play to chelsea for getting through but i thought they left too many gaps in midfield & could have been destroyed only for Lyon were off their game, they will be annihilated by Barcelona if they do that in semis, plus the Lyon first penno miss should have been retaken as the keeper came way off her line, but look its done now so they have to focus on the nxt game"
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm glad Chelsea got through but with both Chelsea saves it did look like the keeper was off her line. I didn't see the penalties live, just this footage."
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm a Chelsea fan and I love the women team so much as they have been the joy of Chelsea fans this season. That being said, that was not a penalty. And if they don't play better, Barcelona women will blow them away...........the penalty take Mjelde was cool as ice"
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon deserved to win but it was a foolish challenge by Becho and it cost them dearly...  And even Lyon would've struggled against Barcelona in the semi's.  Chelsea have even less of a chance but an upset is always possible.
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren and Reece are TRUE jems of this club... even mason mount... proper chels
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'll admit that I stopped watching at the 119th minute, what little faith I have! Well-done you superb Chelsea ladies!"
XVRlNJxakqA,I'm happy for our keeper's input during the shootouts but not during the open-play.
XVRlNJxakqA,"Never a pen tbh, nevertheless Barça is waiting 😈"
XVRlNJxakqA,The best club 🙇💁🦁💙
XVRlNJxakqA,Never a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James is special. What a player 💯💯🔥🔥
XVRlNJxakqA,That was no penalty...
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm sorry but Erikson makes me nervous. She doesn't convince me one bit. I can't believe she's the captain. She makes so many mistakes. That first goal of Lyon, she was ball watching and doesn't mark the 1st post. Second Lyon goal was also her fault. She failed to position herself well to be able to clear the ball. I wish Bright will be back for the semis. Erikson is too raw for me, I'm sorry. Chelsea should consider getting another Buchanan to back Bright."
XVRlNJxakqA,I fall in  love we this Chelsea women's
XVRlNJxakqA,But how was that a pen ??
XVRlNJxakqA,great game on both team
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James; Chelsea's engine
XVRlNJxakqA,"Ericsson tried to bottle it up for Chelsea,Bright was missed,Lauren James is our best player this season,Mjelda and Carter all had a wonderful night,Berger is the hero of the night"
XVRlNJxakqA,shame on Chelsea with an imagineray penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,"Chelsea keeper came off her line before Lyon players struck the ball for both penalties saved at the end, should have been retaken."
XVRlNJxakqA,"What the Men can do, the Women can do better"
XVRlNJxakqA,How the tables turn at the last minute. Holding the ball inside the penalty area and hoping someone fouls you can change a whole game
XVRlNJxakqA,I was crying 😭…. But happy
XVRlNJxakqA,Ericsson almost did 2 big mistakes on both legs 😅😅😅
XVRlNJxakqA,"Berger, Frohms, Grohs, and in the last years Schult, Angerer, Rottenberg... Germany has the greatest GK on earth without any doubt!"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea is massive! 🔵
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea with ANOTHER robbery💀
XVRlNJxakqA,James has a future in acting... Chelsea has the most players who take the best penalty kicks!
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea fan but that was no penalty. She should be auditioning in Hollywood.
XVRlNJxakqA,First penalty wasn´t correct  !!!
XVRlNJxakqA,That soft penalty robbery really 😂😂
XVRlNJxakqA,Can't wait for the World Cup...watching how great all these players are so far....its awesome!
XVRlNJxakqA,"But Chelsea need to work on defence , everything is okay"
XVRlNJxakqA,She's gonna win ballodor if she plays like this and by the help of her teammates
XVRlNJxakqA,Same old Chelsea always cheating
XVRlNJxakqA,wasn't a penalty though
XVRlNJxakqA,That's not a penalty. And the Chelsea keeper goes out of the line. It's should have been a retake
XVRlNJxakqA,And Where is The penalty?
XVRlNJxakqA,Wow...... infact I gave up on the ladies and stopped watching when the second goal went in. I woke up only this morning seeing a pop up on my phone about the result. Great win from my Blue Ladies.... well done. 💙👌💙
XVRlNJxakqA,"Love this channel..
Your highlights are always clear"
XVRlNJxakqA,Do they not check the keeper coming off the line for penalties in the woman’s game?
XVRlNJxakqA,The last penalty rule violation by Berger..So Chelsea didn't deserve.
XVRlNJxakqA,Nobody talking about the terrible penalty decision that ruined the whole tie?
XVRlNJxakqA,We’ve all Withness something last night😂😂😂
XVRlNJxakqA,"Thanks for showing these great games freely, DAZN."
XVRlNJxakqA,Wmns champion league is getting better and better
XVRlNJxakqA,"a game where defences & midfield ruled, cuthbert & Van da donk, Buccanan & Renard were all brilliant"
XVRlNJxakqA,"I was literally so sad in in last 2 mins had no hope but then Lauren got clipped. VAR you know what that means, pen. I WAS SCARED for my life. The way we scored that pen was cool. World class. And the fact that we won on penalties, I can call this best game of tournament so far. I was delighted"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Lauren will get better and better, shes a beast wallahi ✅✅✅"
XVRlNJxakqA,That is no where near a penalty haha shocking decision absolutely
XVRlNJxakqA,"Also the last Lyon s penalty, Chelsea goalkeeper left her line early ........."
XVRlNJxakqA,At this point we need to transfer some of these women to the men's team... 💙💙💙LOVE THE SPIRIT..COYB
XVRlNJxakqA,That penalty in xtra time isnt a penalty tho
XVRlNJxakqA,I am happy there are fans supporting them in this game. Congratulations to both sides for having amazing fans. Entertaining game had us on the edge of our seat. The late drama is just typical champions league spirit 😊. Nice to see this kind of scene in women's game.
XVRlNJxakqA,The celebrating for lyons first goal😂😂😂
XVRlNJxakqA,"The last minute , are you sure penalty for Chelsea ? 
I think is not penalty 😂"
XVRlNJxakqA,Never a penalty though
XVRlNJxakqA,No penalty lol
XVRlNJxakqA,"Lauren James is world class, world class!"
XVRlNJxakqA,Ucl at stamford bridge just hits different 💙
XVRlNJxakqA,What a rediculous penalty decision in minute 120. The referees seem to like Chelsea in international games💸
XVRlNJxakqA,Never a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea will be destroyed by Barcelona 22 April 😎
XVRlNJxakqA,Cuthbert is the N'golo Kante of the ladies team. She was a monster in that midfield
XVRlNJxakqA,"Chelsea got a nice present with that 90+2 ""penalty""..."
XVRlNJxakqA,The Chelsea  captain is the weak link in the defence I have watched many matches were she gives away silly balls that lead to goal......
XVRlNJxakqA,"That penalty by Mjelde was on another level compared to the last few penalties taken by havertz. She was so calm and composed. Havertz on the other side, misses his first penalty after beoming the main penalty taker since jorghinos departure. Luckily he got to retake it."
XVRlNJxakqA,Don't goallies have to stay on their line until pens are taken in the women's game?
XVRlNJxakqA,Who is that Chelsea's number 16?   Worst player on the pitch. What a disaster.
XVRlNJxakqA,Best match in the competition so far. Intensity and quality all round.
XVRlNJxakqA,"I that Barcelona were the once who is paying ref, but I was wrong, how is that a penalty?🤣😂"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea captain is useless
XVRlNJxakqA,I turned it off at 2 minutes into injury time extra time and only just found out that they did give that penalty.
XVRlNJxakqA,WHAT A GAME! PROUD OF THE BLUES
XVRlNJxakqA,Fkin VAR saved us tbh
XVRlNJxakqA,"no penalty for me, James were searching the contact, see how the left leg bends to the right to the defender...."
XVRlNJxakqA,This James's family was born for footfall❤
XVRlNJxakqA,Sam kerr is a magic for chelsea
XVRlNJxakqA,i dont like that 120min var decision to give a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,"So much drama at the end of this match! And heartbreaking to see Horan crying after the penalty save. 
May the best teams get through to the final!"
XVRlNJxakqA,Erikson making such huge mistakes twice  and costing the team 😢
XVRlNJxakqA,"😂😂😂 whats, pinalty???"
XVRlNJxakqA,"If we can overcome Barca, we will win it."
XVRlNJxakqA,So proud of Chelsea tonight never say die attitude .come on..
XVRlNJxakqA,"LJ is an absolute baller
Come on Chelsea"
XVRlNJxakqA,1st save from Chelsea....goalkeeper position isn't ok..it's not a goal..
XVRlNJxakqA,Penalty?
XVRlNJxakqA,What a match😮
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren is such a baller man. Just like her brother Reecey
XVRlNJxakqA,its not penalty come on bro🤣
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm a chelsea fans , it wasn't a penalty for really"
XVRlNJxakqA,Is this football? This is comedy. James was the only person on the pitch coming close to football.
XVRlNJxakqA,I'm just here for AKB's knee slide celebration
XVRlNJxakqA,"Barcelona about to win this year, great Job by Chelsea"
XVRlNJxakqA,"with lyon out, barcelona most likely will win it or i should say strong favourites"
XVRlNJxakqA,What a moment! what a match! COYB Great job ladies.
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon were robbed that was never a pen
XVRlNJxakqA,Funny penalty given
XVRlNJxakqA,"This is far better exciting,tense and interesting than watching the men's  chelsea team"
XVRlNJxakqA,They look like u 10 hahahahahaha woman gets more then the man thats totally fair...hahahahaha
XVRlNJxakqA,Clear dive😂😂😂
XVRlNJxakqA,The women’s Chelsea should trade places with the masculine team !
XVRlNJxakqA,"This is so unfair, the goalkeeper must remain with both of her feets on the goal line at the time of execution of the penalty, thing that she didn't , I'm not fan of any of this teams but gotta say"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Disappointing mistake by the Lyon player in the box, she didn't need to go for a tackle as another Lyon defender (Carpenter I think) had it covered, there would've been a corner kick at best"
XVRlNJxakqA,If it was milli bright in place of ericksson we won't even concede those two goals
XVRlNJxakqA,not foullll . not penalty chuakzzz
XVRlNJxakqA,That wasn't a penalty. VAR just wants Chelsea to win.
XVRlNJxakqA,Boehly pays VAR
XVRlNJxakqA,Cool to see Lauren James is also doing well.
XVRlNJxakqA,that gk celebration at the end lol
XVRlNJxakqA,Emma must do something with those 2 Centre Back. A lot of mistakes on defense. Whatta game! My heart's almost stop beating.
XVRlNJxakqA,This is CHELSEA! We will go against the 2 most important teams in Spain (men and women)
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea got outplayed over the two legs. But the best team doesn't always win. *shrug*
XVRlNJxakqA,"What a Game
 Between Che vs OLy 😱🔥🔥🔥"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea 💙
XVRlNJxakqA,That's the lightest pen i seen i a while.
XVRlNJxakqA,The Chelsea keeper is actually better than kepa
XVRlNJxakqA,ann-katrin berger. incredible saves on that penalty shootout. well deserved Chelsea 👏
XVRlNJxakqA,"I like Chelsea, but Chelsea women did not deserve to go through."
XVRlNJxakqA,How come the goalkeeper was allowed to step out of the line before the kick was taken. The saves would have been retaken.
XVRlNJxakqA,"Vamos Barca 
Barca will win the uwcl 🎉"
XVRlNJxakqA,How can Laura James tripping herself be a penalty. There was no contact with her by the lyon player. Lyon have been robbed big time. The ref and VAR needs medicine for thier glaucoma. 😡😡
XVRlNJxakqA,Fair play to chelsea but that was a soft penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea ❤❤❤❤❤💪
XVRlNJxakqA,So English goalkeepers are allowed to leave the line before the penalty is kicked. I didn't know about this specific rule.
XVRlNJxakqA,VAR corruption at its best
XVRlNJxakqA,"I'm so glad Lyon is out xD. But to be fair... in the PK shootout, Chelsea's goal keeper got in front of the goal line way before the kicker take the shot, both penalties should have been repeated in today's rules."
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon won many times let the rest pls 😂😂😂
XVRlNJxakqA,DIDNT KNOW THE CHELSEA OWNER OLD TODD IS ALSO THE WOMANS MANAGER LOL
XVRlNJxakqA,Magdalena Erikson destroyer the game
XVRlNJxakqA,7:53 Did she not step out of line too early??
XVRlNJxakqA,Erikson time at the Bridge is over
XVRlNJxakqA,This game was rigged this is robbery to Lyon
XVRlNJxakqA,playing bunch of sissies
XVRlNJxakqA,They are going to need a lot more than VAR cheat code against Barcelona Femeni thou.. Infact they shud just let the Male team play the semis 😂😂
XVRlNJxakqA,"LYON WAS ROBBED!!! THAT'S NOT A PENALTY IN A THOUSAND LIFETIMES....
MAFIAAAAAAA"
XVRlNJxakqA,UP THE CHELS! COYB
XVRlNJxakqA,"Chelsea fc ladies was never really in the match in the second half and extra time until that penalty,it was just like a miracle for Chelsea to get that penalty out of nothing."
XVRlNJxakqA,I'm glad both french teams we're defeated.
XVRlNJxakqA,bruh what a game.
XVRlNJxakqA,Erickson was really poor
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon comfortably the better side. Barca will batter Chelsea in the SF.
XVRlNJxakqA,Why weren’t the rest of the players around the box for the penalty in the last min?
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren and Reece definitely trained a lot together growing up. They mirror each other in style
XVRlNJxakqA,Let’s go chelsea
XVRlNJxakqA,Poor play by womens😅😅😅
XVRlNJxakqA,"Keeper off her line for every pen, how could that not be looked at? Makes no sense"
XVRlNJxakqA,That was not a penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,No way that’s a pen💀💀
XVRlNJxakqA,The robbery of the century at Stamford Bridge. The referee saw the penalty when they gave her the money. Corrupt Chelsea buying referees.
XVRlNJxakqA,I stopped watching the game with less than 2 mins to end extra time only to later find on the Chelsea women's page on Instagram that Chelsea were through to the semis. Imagine my shock and dumbfounded face
XVRlNJxakqA,"On penalties, the Chelsea goalkeeper takes the lead before kick-off. Why wasn't that sanctioned?"
XVRlNJxakqA,The referee is a 🤡Chelsea 💩💩💩🤮🤮🤮
XVRlNJxakqA,That wasn’t a pen. James dived 😂
XVRlNJxakqA,Lets. Do this
XVRlNJxakqA,She tripped on her own leg.
XVRlNJxakqA,Gowan the blues 💙
XVRlNJxakqA,An absolute ridiculous penalty. Cheating in women's football too?
XVRlNJxakqA,"My favorite color . BLue is on the top.of Champion leauge. Blue lion of London. Great Blues, great roar.❤"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Only Chelsea women team care about the club. Thats all I need to know. 
Attitude, passion, mentality, desire. 
Nobody cares about the men's team"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea's captain is not so fantastic tonight.
XVRlNJxakqA,"Happy Chelsea won, but Eriksson seems to be getting worse as the games go on this year. Just one bad decision after another."
XVRlNJxakqA,An Instant classic
XVRlNJxakqA,Is it a penalty that simulation?????? 🤔🤔🤔🤔 I think no!
XVRlNJxakqA,Couldn’t believe it and if we can beat Lyon Women than we can do anything while beating PSG Women twice in the group stage let’s go blues
XVRlNJxakqA,The girls showing how its done. Now its up to the men´s team vs. real to replicate it.
XVRlNJxakqA,"That was a ridiculous, absurd penalty call on Lyon in the last minute of the match. VAR stole the match from the French team. That was in no way a penalty---beyond soft. Disgraceful call. Chelsea did not deserve to win that match."
XVRlNJxakqA,The penalty is a joke ! Scandalous
XVRlNJxakqA,"BLATANT CHEATING 
  We all know"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Women PremierLrague best league in Europe, Barcellona is the strongest team, but nobody have 4 teams Chelsea,Arsenal,United,City from quarterfinals/semifinals of WUCL"
XVRlNJxakqA,"Right now, Iam so proud of the club #upthechels #ChelseaFC #championsofeurope"
XVRlNJxakqA,The penalty wasn't a penalty....as usual the Brits cheat...
XVRlNJxakqA,Yes chelsea. Come on you blues!!!! 🎉
XVRlNJxakqA,I would never have believed it if someone told me in 2023 I’d be supporting the women’s CHELS more than the men’s
XVRlNJxakqA,"Highway robbery, one of the softest penalties ever. A great injustice has been done to Lyon!!"
XVRlNJxakqA,Chelsea need to be investigated for paying the VAR people and the ref Lauren trips up on her own leg and it wasn't a clear and obvious error
XVRlNJxakqA,Happy for Women football
XVRlNJxakqA,Erikson could've done better to prevent those two goals. She has been a bit of a liability as of late
XVRlNJxakqA,That was not a penalty what a awful decision
XVRlNJxakqA,I understand the significance and I understand that players are human and people too but I was surprised that horan cried at the end knowing how many big tournaments she’s been in and how experienced she is
XVRlNJxakqA,THAT penalty is a SHAME 😡😡
XVRlNJxakqA,"Bye bye olympique de madrid, thx Chelsea, this champions going to barcelona 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽"
XVRlNJxakqA,How are people saying that’s not a penalty? She makes contact with James’ leg which then makes her go down. Literally a stone wall penalty
XVRlNJxakqA,What a save that is to win it 🙏🏼
XVRlNJxakqA,What an incredible game
XVRlNJxakqA,"Shameful refereeing decisions - no penalty for Chelsea in e.t., and both saves on the penalties shot out must be retaken because the Chelsea goalkeeper moves from the line before the shot."
XVRlNJxakqA,UEFA = corruption
XVRlNJxakqA,That was not penalty 😂
XVRlNJxakqA,How can the officials not see that the Chelsea keeper is a yard off her line when the penalty kicks are taken? Admittedly she has to go the right way to be in a position to make the save but it makes a complete mockery of the penalty shootout.
XVRlNJxakqA,Congratulations to the whole Chelsea fan
XVRlNJxakqA,"That's not a penalty for every touch, the referee was right. VAR is just making it worse."
XVRlNJxakqA,Lyon was robbed. Chelsea are cheaters. I hope they get knocked out of the tournament.
XVRlNJxakqA,How was that a pen
XVRlNJxakqA,"120+2mins and the boys are losing, will they ever make it through just like the girls with? with Harry Potter in charge ?????😊"
XVRlNJxakqA,Is this the sister of chelseas James?
XVRlNJxakqA,Why didn't you show all of the penalties?
XVRlNJxakqA,Great game blues
XVRlNJxakqA,They fought well...deserved it ✌🏾
XVRlNJxakqA,They are better penalty taker than the mens team 👏🏼
XVRlNJxakqA,Brilliant penalty save to win it
XVRlNJxakqA,Leupolz  take care  ❤💪🏻 my best wishes
XVRlNJxakqA,Lauren James will surely bounce back from the missed penalty and become even more dominant.
XVRlNJxakqA,I don’t agree with the penalty decision but what a finish 🤩
XVRlNJxakqA,No pen reff fvkin terrible
XVRlNJxakqA,Well done Chelsea !
XVRlNJxakqA,My girls will never let me down! I am so proud!
XVRlNJxakqA,What a match 💙🤍🔥
XVRlNJxakqA,What a game!! I had to say I didn't expect it!!
XVRlNJxakqA,We don’t need the VAR 🤷🏻‍♂️
XVRlNJxakqA,This is the golden age for women’s football in England for certain for clubs and country
LG601aTJ3Rw,"Neutral here. No penalty against Lyon 🙅‍♂️. The 2 penalties stoped by Chelsea should not be counted, the goalkeeper is advancing from the line. ❌❌ Incompetence from the referee and illegally robbed to Lyon."
LG601aTJ3Rw,I wanna build a time machine and go back to 1980 or whenever it was so I can stop penalty shootouts from being invented after that maybe try to do something about  AIDS too but only if I have some time left over
LG601aTJ3Rw,Football is dead. Call it VAR Football from now.
LG601aTJ3Rw,CROOKS !
LG601aTJ3Rw,The lads can learn from Chelsea’s penalties all top bins!!!
LG601aTJ3Rw,poor refering-never a penalty-fell over her own feet-pathetic
LG601aTJ3Rw,Straight robbery
LG601aTJ3Rw,The softest penalty I’ve ever seen
LG601aTJ3Rw,"Before concluding its not a penalty,watch the video very well"
LG601aTJ3Rw,first time i've ever seen a goalkeeper do a kneeslide and it was lovely😂
LG601aTJ3Rw,"I dont know how no 15 become che captain. Make a lot of mistake. 

Before this, 2 goals against mancity also from her mistake.

Please manager use other option."
LG601aTJ3Rw,"It's a f*ing disgrace. Shame on James, shame on referees, shame on UEFA."
LG601aTJ3Rw,Penalti light…
LG601aTJ3Rw,Chelsea 🙏🙏
LG601aTJ3Rw,"That Chelsea Keeper Berger and Lauren James kept them in this ,Kerr oughta scored from that chance she spurned judging from her pedigree,she almost cost Chelsea,but Chelsea left back needs to be orientated,all goals and most of the attack came from her flank,they might have discovered she's weak"
LG601aTJ3Rw,*No one's gonna continue taking this sport seriously if the refs keep clearly helping teams out. Not producing a fair game makes people lose interest*
LG601aTJ3Rw,6:05 *How is that even a penalty?? She tripped on her own foot if anything it should be a yellow for diving* 🙄🤦‍♂️
LG601aTJ3Rw,Clear penalty
LG601aTJ3Rw,"She trips over her own feet 😂 , appalling decision."
LG601aTJ3Rw,"The game was clearly a penalty,Lyon has a direct with James leg while she have the opportunity to aim at the ball… Thanks to VAR"
LG601aTJ3Rw,"It WAS a penalty , yes   I didnt look properly at first  I too, was like : nah, that ain a pen  Then, I seen the lower camera angles"
LG601aTJ3Rw,Too much mistakes from the Chelsea captain Erickson. Chelsea might have escaped it tonight but might not be so lucky against others. Lauren was awesome. Kerr really needs to do more. Emma needs to work on that defence. Credit to the team cos Lyon is not an easy team to beat especially in the champions league.
LG601aTJ3Rw,Chelsea women fc❤
LG601aTJ3Rw,Shakey Captain...blue..!😢
LG601aTJ3Rw,Totally robbery how’s that a penalty 😅
LG601aTJ3Rw,"Disgraceful penalty call on Lyon by VAR/referee. It was absurd--beyond soft. A slight bump and she embellishes and you decide the match with that call? That match was stolen from Lyon, IMO. Terrible decision."
LG601aTJ3Rw,This penalty is a FCKing joke
LG601aTJ3Rw,Trip over your own feet and you get a penalty .???
LG601aTJ3Rw,That penalty call was atrocious. Like be for real. Chelsea did not deserve this. Lyon got robbed big time
LG601aTJ3Rw,I wonder the goal keeper was not on the line?
LG601aTJ3Rw,Chelsea need to be investigated for paying the VAR people and the ref Lauren trips up on her own leg and it wasn't a clear and obvious error
LG601aTJ3Rw,Penalty really what a awful descion
LG601aTJ3Rw,"I see lots lamenting about the Pk here. It happens to be in favour of chelsea last night, let them enjoy it. There's actually been times it was against them. That's the football we watch now VAR did the right thing It's always down to the refree to make the final call so i guess it was Chelsea lucky night. Goodluck to the remaining teams in the UCL"
LG601aTJ3Rw,Chelsea all time with a scandalous penalty... It ain't penalty in nowhere place ...
LG601aTJ3Rw,That was not a penalty
LG601aTJ3Rw,Lauren James is a baller and Reynard is a rock at defence.
LG601aTJ3Rw,Doesn't matter its going to be Barcelona v German team.
LG601aTJ3Rw,"Lyon was robbed, 5:50  no honest referee will said this was penalty...   Incredible.. 
Then 7:59 the goalkeeper step ahead before the penalty is kick..  that should be kick again. 
Well, Barcelona will need to apply justice and eliminate Chelsea  5-0 or more..   No referee will be able to save Chelsea against that."
LG601aTJ3Rw,Amazing penalty by Ref..
LG601aTJ3Rw,"The goalkeeper steps forward the line before the taker contacts the ball in both saved penalties, hence those should have been retaken"
LG601aTJ3Rw,Referee 💵💵💵💵💵 shame on you
LG601aTJ3Rw,That wasn't a penalty 😅
LG601aTJ3Rw,Where il the penalty 😂😂😂😂😂
LG601aTJ3Rw,James had lost control of the ball.
LG601aTJ3Rw,"Barca women will take this champions league 😂😂😂 bye, Chelsea will be knocked out in the next stage, that wasn’t a penalty"
LG601aTJ3Rw,"Disgusting pen, Chelsea totally bailed by the referee. They don't have the level for the semis, the other teams have been more consistent."
LG601aTJ3Rw,"Chelsea womens vs Lyon womens (8 titles record)
Chelsea vs real Madrid (14 titles record)"
LG601aTJ3Rw,The penalty is a false call…
LG601aTJ3Rw,This is awesome…
LG601aTJ3Rw,How is that a penalty? She clearly moves away from the Ball looking for contact
LG601aTJ3Rw,"A GAME FOR THE AGES, WOMEN FOOTBALL ON THE RISE"
LG601aTJ3Rw,Did Chelsea pay the ref. That is not a penalty. Please investigate this disgrace.
LG601aTJ3Rw,Too many fatal mistakes from the Blues's captain. Since the first leg. Almost causing the game.
LG601aTJ3Rw,Scandalous penalty. A shame
LG601aTJ3Rw,Nice game COYB
LG601aTJ3Rw,"Lyon— It's not Christmas yet.
 VAR — I don’t care."
LG601aTJ3Rw,What a disgrace
LG601aTJ3Rw,Man of the match: the ref
LG601aTJ3Rw,What a come back
LG601aTJ3Rw,Dont be surprised its a london thing
LG601aTJ3Rw,"Great game, well done the Chels! 👏👏👏"
LG601aTJ3Rw,Champions of Europe soon on both men’s and women team

rtC1vV1-MoY,"The person with the highest score in this match is Danielle Van de Donk. A completely different game from the first match (DvD just played in second half), Lyon needs to understand the value of the bright Dutch star. Chelsea players didn't even have the desired passes with DvD's smart play and high pressing."
rtC1vV1-MoY,A classy header pass from Van de Donk.
rtC1vV1-MoY,The best moment was when James failed.
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Don't have people at DAZN, who can pronounce the name of the players correctly?"
rtC1vV1-MoY,The commentators are so biased. When Lyon was already winning with 2goals they were suddenly not talking much. When the penalty happened for Chelsea they're suddenly so alive and have so much to say 😂
rtC1vV1-MoY,Barca has élimined the cheaters of Chelsea!! Thanks Barça !!
rtC1vV1-MoY,NO PENALTY THIS A HOLD UP AGAINST LYON!!
rtC1vV1-MoY,how was that a penalty it was a super light touch but she knew that falling would be their last chance to win
rtC1vV1-MoY,chelsea my team wow women
rtC1vV1-MoY,"It’s so clear what the ref wanted before that last minute penalty. She wanted to send the players away because the penalty would be the last action. But the error lies in disregarding the possibility of a rebound - this must be taken by any player, which means any player of the other team needs to get the chance for clearance. So the ref was wrong there."
rtC1vV1-MoY,1:37:50 Penalty for Lyon... VAR does not react... how strange ! 😇😂
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Chelsea don't deserve it, apart from Reiten's super goal, they didn't show anything. And without Kerr and James, I'm not even talking about it. Chelsea fans have to pray they don't get hurt."
rtC1vV1-MoY,1:32:56 this was just so nasty
rtC1vV1-MoY,Was excited to watch this but having an ad break literally every five minutes (while game play is on) is a joke. After the third ad in less than twenty minutes a goal had been missed. I give up with DAZN. Clearly don't care about viewer experience whatsoever. Just money grabbers.
rtC1vV1-MoY,"As always English teams got that referee help,typical"
rtC1vV1-MoY,"That was NEVER a penalty, she tripped herself over, that referee is a disgrace. 🤨👎👎👎"
rtC1vV1-MoY,Watched on phone. Stopped watching when they made it 2 -0. Could not believe my phone the next day. Cmon the chels. I wish our men's team had their heart and belief. Emma Hayes could do a job in men's football. No doubt.
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Yes, Chelsea last minute penalty kept their hopes alive. But why could Lyon as the 8 time champions not kick their penalties like champions and win the match."
rtC1vV1-MoY,"I just hope the semis will be exciting like this match. There's no excitement in 90minute matches, when extra time is available."
rtC1vV1-MoY,"There is no contact at all! Look at the view we see at 2.48.15, it’s a real emulation !"
rtC1vV1-MoY,Well done to Chelsea women hopefully they can emulate the men and youth teams and win the Champions League🏆⚽
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Had it been that Chelsea men have football coach like their female counterparts, we could have been a bit hopeful that we can win something."
rtC1vV1-MoY,That was never a penalty. I am yet to see footage showing that the Lyon defender made a leg move and made contact with Recce James's sister's legs.
rtC1vV1-MoY,So glad Chelsea won..and delighted renard the French trouble maker lost 😂 and also missed the penalty 🎉😢
rtC1vV1-MoY,"The ref couldn´t handle the pressure from Chelsea about given them that penalty or not. Lyon-player didn´t kick any leg. 
The commentary neutral :)))) ?! Yes, I saw the whole match and Lyon was better overall.
10 sec from semifinal and then this awful decision by the ref."
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Everyone saying that was not a pen. As long as the rule is applied, it's a pen. I have watched both male and female football and have seen softer pens. Including in the world cup."
rtC1vV1-MoY,"melanie leupolz breaks her nose 1:32:30

rtC1vV1-MoY,"I always cheer for Olympique Lyonnais because I am a big fan of Horan but, to be honest it was a penalty and that is a fact seen the video a few times big hug to Horan💗"
rtC1vV1-MoY,How was that a pen? 😂
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Amazing finish, what a cool head to take that penalty in the 120th minute...Hey girl, give Harry Kane some pointers on not bottling it at penalties, thx...."
rtC1vV1-MoY,Wat a big match 👏 the sky is blue 💙
rtC1vV1-MoY,Sam really did a no looker for the penalty and scored
rtC1vV1-MoY,"I can't believe the revisionism on here... how people can say they don't understand how it's a pen I have no idea. Soft, maybe, but I've seen A LOT softer than that given. Talk of bias is ridiculous given the ways decisions went in the match."
rtC1vV1-MoY,What a robbery... 😂
rtC1vV1-MoY,Barca will butcher Chelsea. The penalty was a joke.
rtC1vV1-MoY,"this was the most spectacular soccer I have EVER watched!! I cried in the end, so happy for Berger!!!"
rtC1vV1-MoY,This match was crazy!!!
rtC1vV1-MoY,@2:38:07 Lyon should deserve a freekick. the ball is out of the box in her hands
rtC1vV1-MoY,Shame on the referee for giving a non existing penalty !
rtC1vV1-MoY,What a farce ! No way it can be a penalty...
rtC1vV1-MoY,Chelsea going to  meet   FC barcelona   semi-final   on 22 april
rtC1vV1-MoY,"NEVER a pen, she tripped herself up! Watch it from 2:49:06 onwards and put the player on to a slower playback speed... (0.5 or slower) and you'll see at 2:49:13 that she trips herself up!
Laughable VAR effort, on a par with the mens game!"
rtC1vV1-MoY,James siblings have the football blood. Props up to their parents for encouraging them both to hone their talent!
rtC1vV1-MoY,Just imagine both the Chelsea men and women team getting both finals and winning them
rtC1vV1-MoY,VAR steal the game
rtC1vV1-MoY,Waooo…. Up blues !
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Shameless dive. Really... What's the point of VAR? It's a contact sport, she tripped her own leg. Oldest trick in the book."
rtC1vV1-MoY,the pen was a joke. clipped own heels
rtC1vV1-MoY,Just to be Clear the Refereeing was absolutely against Chelsea . . . No Red Card for Van de Donk and No yellows for Lyon players in so many offences and the Ref allowed them to play a Corner at the End of 2nd Half Additional Time by 20 Sec ( While she didn't allow Chelsea to counter and complete the min and didn't allow Chelsea to play a very well earned Free Kick at the end of the First ) . . . She Didn't want to Give the PK which was Freaking 200% CLeaaaaaaaaaaar !
rtC1vV1-MoY,"If you want to work your cardio, watch this match!"
rtC1vV1-MoY,We are Chelsea 💙
rtC1vV1-MoY,That's never a pen tho
rtC1vV1-MoY,"that penalty shootout was awful, most the pens were so predictable. also wasn’t a penalty in extra time, lyon should of won"
rtC1vV1-MoY,"I have to say Chelsea really wanted that win. Even when they were close to being eliminated they never gave up. Wow they are warriors. Well done Lyon too, they did amazing in terms of the performance. However games can change just like that and we have witnessed something insane tonight."
rtC1vV1-MoY,the blue bloods will go further!💙😭💙
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Extraordinary ending, the clip on the heels, the delayed decision, then the amazing precision of Chelsea's penalties. A fantastic example of mind over matter: Lyon mind, but Chelsea matter."
rtC1vV1-MoY,Unbelievable The blues❤❤
rtC1vV1-MoY,Chelsea 💙
rtC1vV1-MoY,How Tf was that a penalty 😂😂😂
rtC1vV1-MoY,Chelsea fan but to be honest that penalty could’ve gone either way and it would be right. Far too difficult to decide.
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Hayes has been so consistent with her winning teams, class act."
rtC1vV1-MoY,Every goal keeper jumped well off line thought that’s not aloud
rtC1vV1-MoY,softest pen in football history 😂 Hope Barca kickes them out (as a Real fan😅)
rtC1vV1-MoY,"All the way Chelsea, I hoped some injured Chelsea players to recover for Barcelona ties. I knew mens team watched the game. Massive congratulations to Chelsea Women FC from 🇳🇬"
rtC1vV1-MoY,People who are saying is not penalty should go watch it again
rtC1vV1-MoY,This was the final. Any other match after this is a friendly
rtC1vV1-MoY,"As an Englishman, never a penalty. Lyon the better team. Can only see Barcelona winning this competition with ease now. That is nothing against Chelsea or Arsenal, but simple fact."
rtC1vV1-MoY,"I celebrated it because I'm a Barcelona fan, but it wasn't penalty 😂😂😂"
rtC1vV1-MoY,Never a penalty cheating Lauren James the man
rtC1vV1-MoY,Quite the most unfair penalty decision in all my 45 years of watching football.. I hope Lyon can and will appeal..
rtC1vV1-MoY,Just went there
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Lauren James subbed before halftime against City at the weekend and here wins a penalty at a critical moment smart in ghosting past two players and receiving a clear foul...


Incredible mentality at 21!"
rtC1vV1-MoY,"I stopped watching at 3 minutes to the end knowing my Chelsea is kicked out, only to be told 30 minutes later we won.  We must beat Barca"
rtC1vV1-MoY,"1:26:45 That is a penalty. They explain it as well. Listen and take a closer look, people!"
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Congratulations Chelsea, Big hug for Wendie, Horan ,keep strong lyon❤"
rtC1vV1-MoY,Man utd fans crying not a penalty. Keep crying.
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Woow what a game I liked Chelsea sprit never give up..lesson learned chelsea men do the same with real Madrid, nd Emma Hayes to replace Potter 😂😂"
rtC1vV1-MoY,Amazing!!! We've beaten the holders now let's go for the trophy 🏆
rtC1vV1-MoY,CHELSEA💙💙
rtC1vV1-MoY,Never in any doubt 😛 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
rtC1vV1-MoY,Referee masterclass 🤣🤣🤣 MOTM
rtC1vV1-MoY,no penalty no penalty no penalty   winner lyon
rtC1vV1-MoY,The referee  stole the match for chelsea.that last minute penalty the referee gave was very very disgraceful.
rtC1vV1-MoY,How much did Chelsea pay the referees?
rtC1vV1-MoY,never penalty... how can someone fall so easily?
rtC1vV1-MoY,Chelsea💙
rtC1vV1-MoY,Barca champions ☺️
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Women premier league best league in europe,Chelsea,Arsenal to the semifinals of uwcl and in the league at least 2 teams at the same level,United and City"
rtC1vV1-MoY,CHELSEA!! always my club
rtC1vV1-MoY,COYB💙💙💙
rtC1vV1-MoY,"I'm a blue through and through but respectfully that's not a penalty
But shamelessly we'll take it...
Unto the semis...."
rtC1vV1-MoY,Corruption
rtC1vV1-MoY,Hey referee!!  How much money Did u get???
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Rugby does a better job at reviewing than what football does, it's an absolute joke. stuff like this needs looking at from multiple angles and slowing down.

I'm English and want the English teams to win but not by cheating!"
rtC1vV1-MoY,"This was very difficult to watch. I don't want Chelsea to have any success, but maybe the distraction can benefit Man United with the WSL title."
rtC1vV1-MoY,Then Ready For Barca.... 😂😂😂
rtC1vV1-MoY,Last minute penalty was a joke
rtC1vV1-MoY,Mentality monsters ! I’m 60 tomorrow…. Thanks girls the best early 60th birthday present !
rtC1vV1-MoY,No penalty !!!!!!!!!
rtC1vV1-MoY,Penalty regalado al chelsea
rtC1vV1-MoY,Shame. Lyon deserved to win
rtC1vV1-MoY,The refereeing was shameful. How someone who does this job can give such a non-existent penalty at the last minute... it's ridiculous. English corruption won tonight
rtC1vV1-MoY,The blues are going to win the women's champions league
rtC1vV1-MoY,"On first view, i thought it was a clear pull back on James, watch closely though and she barely touches her, there is very slight contact!

You got away with one there Chelsea."
rtC1vV1-MoY,"I didn't know women's football was corrupt aswell 
But it's positive at least, it shows that it works better than before $$$$$$"
rtC1vV1-MoY,Real chelsea CF
rtC1vV1-MoY,Mjelde ice cold 🥶best of luck against Barca!
rtC1vV1-MoY,HAHAHAHA!! They said female footballers don't dive!
rtC1vV1-MoY,Really thought lyon had it icl
rtC1vV1-MoY,So var shocking in the women game too lol that was never a pen.
rtC1vV1-MoY,CHELSEA WHAT A CLUB CHELSEA FOOTBALL CLUB WOW
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Lyon get robbed, James was clearly dive"
rtC1vV1-MoY,"I like Lyon, but Chelsea were phenomenal 💥💥💥💥💥"
rtC1vV1-MoY,"Complete joke. Chelsea keeper off her line for at least 2 saves. Should have been retaken, the refereeing and Var shocking 🙄"
tz5XV0_cAM4,this match is another example why women should not be allowed in this sport😁😁
tz5XV0_cAM4,The Lyon team has alot of work to do in recruiting. Almost 3/4 of the team is 27+ years old. That's worrying. Hope they don't go down like  frankfurt.
tz5XV0_cAM4,Lindsey Horan i Love you 💗 you are the best ⚽⚽⚽
tz5XV0_cAM4,Chelsea 💩💩💩
tz5XV0_cAM4,"What a robbery ! Can't do more than that !! Referee and VAR more and more awful !! This is pure insanity, disgrace !  Shocking 🤷‍♂️"
tz5XV0_cAM4,"It was clear penalty, Chelsea win love from usa"
tz5XV0_cAM4,It was a soft foul and also it was a penalty 😐
tz5XV0_cAM4,Thank you for the streaming. A Chelsea fan really needed that.
tz5XV0_cAM4,This is cheat!
tz5XV0_cAM4,James is the biggest cheat going! Unbelievable corruption here
tz5XV0_cAM4,"Becho is inexperienced, she was fooled by James who sent the ball to the left while remaining glued to her. James wasn't trying to cross or shoot, she slowed her pace just enough by dragging her foot back which was why she was losing the ball."
tz5XV0_cAM4,Same old CHELSEA always Cheating
tz5XV0_cAM4,"I am very happy for Sara DäBritz.. she has now scored for Bayern Munich, PSG and now Lyon..  I know she suffered heartache in the Euros final against England.. but happy she came off the bench and did very well and got herself on the scoresheet.. twice."
tz5XV0_cAM4,James clearly dived
tz5XV0_cAM4,Might be the only game if you rewatch it that I would have question marks
tz5XV0_cAM4,"Exciting match, for sure."
tz5XV0_cAM4,There was no penalty
tz5XV0_cAM4,"Robbed, now all England's squads must go at least to the semis don't know why 🤔 money talks"
tz5XV0_cAM4,Chelsea 💙💙💙💙💙💙
tz5XV0_cAM4,Chelsea 💙

HB78tCmqYUQ,"PSG AND LYON JUST PLAYED THE SAME WAY. NO SPIRIT OF PLAYING, NO CONCENTRATION, NO MATURITY, VERY POOR PLAYING, NO COMPOSURE, ETC.... TOO BAD FOR DIANÉ WAS INJURED. SHE DESERVES TO GO TO EITHER ARSENAL, CHELSEA OR BARCELONA."

9puuLL-uI2c,Goal of the season… Frida is flying!!!
9puuLL-uI2c,What a strike! Great reaction by Frida.
9puuLL-uI2c,She even had her earings on.. Must be really nervous before the game that she forgot to take them off. 😅😅 Congrats ladies for beating Bayern at home and through to Semifinal. Congrats Maanum and Stina for scoring ❤🤍
9puuLL-uI2c,Arsenal's Goal of the Season for sure. Even the men must have loved it 🥰😍🤩🥳
9puuLL-uI2c,Watching UWCL ain't that bad especially when you don't got anything else to watch
9puuLL-uI2c,If Arsenal win the UWCL ...this goal would be called  the catalyst that made it happen.
9puuLL-uI2c,"Walti, Stina, Leah and Manuum.  From Walti touching it to the ball hitting the net less than 3 seconds. AWESOME JOB"
9puuLL-uI2c,Where is Mapi Leon's incredible goal video? Yesterday Barça won 5-1 against Roma and Fridolina Rolfo was the woman of the match and this channel don't say anything. Suspicious

O31p8mH_ItM,"Untill now,no surprise at all. If it goes on like that, we'll get a final Barcelona vs Chelsea or Wolfsburg. Arsenal won... but lost Kim Little and Katie McCabe."
O31p8mH_ItM,1:15:04 thank me later
O31p8mH_ItM,The views are insane compared to last year.
O31p8mH_ItM,"Great stuff from the women...terrible weather, tough opponent but they played so well and the crowd played their part too....COYG❤"
O31p8mH_ItM,So depressing even thinking about this football garbage
O31p8mH_ItM,"Hmmm, is it just me or does anyone notice that when *Arsenal* loses a match, the pitchforks come out & primarily get aimed at *Stina Blackstenius?* Yet when they win, those same pitchfork carrying doubters miraculously disappear into thin air. 🤷🏼‍♂️ Funny how that works, huh? 🙄

P.S. Because I don’t live in England (thus meaning I would not get the footy news as quickly as you Londoners do) has anyone heard any updates on the health status of *Kim Little & Katie McCabe* after both left the game today with injury’s?"
O31p8mH_ItM,I don't really know where ds Referees do come from! Both of these refrees on ds 2 legged ties are not just up to the standards at all. Thumbs up for Arsenal ladies to not allow incompetence of the refrees to weigh them down. What a performance for the 2 legs #Coyg
O31p8mH_ItM,"When you see Lina Magull and Schüller subbed its the equivalent in basketball when your starting five are taken off kind of a surrender by Strauss its all on the league for Bayern now...

Clara Bühl was incredible albeit in a losing effort."
O31p8mH_ItM,When you see Lina Magull and Schüller subbed its the equivalent in basketball when your starting five are taken off kind of a surrender by Strauss its all on the league for Bayern now...
O31p8mH_ItM,Ford really gave her all out.. 👏👏👏
O31p8mH_ItM,"Finally, we beat Bayern Munich."
O31p8mH_ItM,"Looking at both games, Arsenal's advancement is well deserved. Especially since they were also disadvantaged in both games by referee decisions. But the team and especially the coach are unsympathetic. No class!"
O31p8mH_ItM,"I am so proud of our ladies! Up Gunners 

I wish them to win this great trophy 🏆"
O31p8mH_ItM,New of the Bayern Women's Champions League What Gunners
O31p8mH_ItM,Leah should stay as captain she inspires her teams to win every time.
O31p8mH_ItM,The Arsenal Women's team gave everything to earn this win in the face of adversity.  This win would take them up a level in terms of belief in the process.
O31p8mH_ItM,"I have support Arsenal for many years, since the 90s, and now I'm starting to follow Woman's football too, but I do not like man coaching ladies, this coach ask his players to fake and disrespect the fair game, this woman's Aresenal team fake sooooo many fouls and loose soooo much time, in this case I think mans team is more honest and fair on their way of playing, I hope this change, because ladies football should be honest, that is the only way I will support Arsenal, play hard but clean and honest!!✌✌✌"
O31p8mH_ItM,"Terrible referee tonight but an incredible performance from the Arsenal ladies, what a goal from Maanum too! COYG off to the Semis 🔥"
O31p8mH_ItM,Is the 7k a year worth being so unattractive

radGCo2hqlc,I hope they can win the champions league
radGCo2hqlc,"Oshoala is a female version of dembele she just can’t finish the chances.all she does is tap ins horrible player,,"
radGCo2hqlc,"I don't know about Chelsea Game tonight, I think she scored in the 1st Leg, Feds are searching for her, that huge forehead"
radGCo2hqlc,Hmmm Chelsea should watch out if they win over Lyon 😂
radGCo2hqlc,who really cares
radGCo2hqlc,Andressa and Vicky losing in the Camp Nou is sad to see ngl. But what a great win for the girls!

qdW_2204j3s,*From iraq with love 🇮🇶 **_-VAMOS BARCA 💙❤-_* ...
qdW_2204j3s,Barca is cheating !! I don’t like barca anymore only attack and buy people to help them !!! Last week stolen a match in La liga very clear !!
3ecxJB63PAA,We have a cheat code that we don’t exploit enough. Pass the ball to graham Hansen = Goal or assist. We need to deliver the ball down that right side more. Easily one of if not our best player.
3ecxJB63PAA,Barcelona go for it!!
3ecxJB63PAA,What a humiliation
3ecxJB63PAA,"The quality of women's football is really poor.

It's lucky if it was parallel with Boys under 9s, no exaggeration."
3ecxJB63PAA,"Enjoyable game, but the ref was horrendous"
3ecxJB63PAA,"Cruel for Roma but that's the difference between a club which can win the Cup and anotherr one which reaches quarter final for the first time. All these brilliant Catalan players not going to the World Cup, what a mess !!!"
3ecxJB63PAA,50k fake barca fans turn upto watch one sided games. yawn.
3ecxJB63PAA,"Can the DAZN commentators PLEASE learn how to pronounce ""Camp nou""!!! (""Camp"" rhymes with Dump; ""nou"" rhymes with know)"

QxVA2qSE1aA,That nutmeg from cuthbert is a beauty ❤
QxVA2qSE1aA,Is she the placement queen or what? Most of her finishes are accurate placements.
QxVA2qSE1aA,Jawohl Chelsea 😊👍⚽️
QxVA2qSE1aA,"So, we hope, the women's football is not suffering more Chelsea-dives......"
QxVA2qSE1aA,"5 star weak foot
I love her roar
Can't wait to see her back"
QxVA2qSE1aA,What a player!..
QxVA2qSE1aA,What a play from Erin though 🤩💙
QxVA2qSE1aA,Beautiful the ladys are doing better than the man 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
QxVA2qSE1aA,great goal and game
QxVA2qSE1aA,"This was a great finish but she definitely las a weaker foot
Watch the whole match and her clearances in the box with her right foot were poor
Top player though"
QxVA2qSE1aA,JUST GENIAL!!!! ❤
QxVA2qSE1aA,defender should be out to that...
ztoZr5pA6XI,Every time corruption. You are killing football
ztoZr5pA6XI,Paris loves to lose against German Teams HAHHAHA
ztoZr5pA6XI,GERMANS have Leopard TANKS . FRANCE has citroen 2 CV (Paris SG)
ztoZr5pA6XI,What a scandal this arbitration 😮
ztoZr5pA6XI,A disgrace that referee 🤦
ztoZr5pA6XI,clear pen the first one
ztoZr5pA6XI,"That wasn't a penalty at all, yes it touched her hand but it was to close and too quick so it shouldn't have been given and not a yellow either"
W-7NUPbtWAE,Today firegame im more PSG.
W-7NUPbtWAE,"..wouldn't believe the ref dissallowed the first penalty for Saint Germain, and then a yellow card for accidental handball, really bad ref.."
W-7NUPbtWAE,Ref had a stinker
W-7NUPbtWAE,How come that wasn't a penalty??
W-7NUPbtWAE,"Just a request, Could you upload the highlights in spanish for non spanish club matches, like this one?"
W-7NUPbtWAE,o
W-7NUPbtWAE,Oberdorf has the POWER to suggest to the refferee...
W-7NUPbtWAE,"why isn't your full coverage the same quality ???? blurred, hard and painful on the eyes....full game 1080p more like 480p"
W-7NUPbtWAE,this is Refereeing at it's worst
W-7NUPbtWAE,Robbery
W-7NUPbtWAE,"Tight, intense game it seems, but the penalty decisions baffle me a bit. From my point of view you either give both or neither, feels a bit unfair for PSG."
W-7NUPbtWAE,I am sure the VAR was an EPL official
W-7NUPbtWAE,Again and again and again referee .. slrsy
W-7NUPbtWAE,"Here it looks like a penalty. But what are these camera angles. Look at the german version, then you understand why it wasnt given"
W-7NUPbtWAE,Rotten match by an English referee who had made her choice. An obvious penalty not whistled in favor of PSG which was stolen by her decisions...! Made in England !
W-7NUPbtWAE,And give second yellow for handball? Ridiculous
W-7NUPbtWAE,"Seems like you need to do some wrestling to get the penalty, or what? Break the knee? If it wasn't penalty, then what is?"
W-7NUPbtWAE,ASSALAMUALAIKUM WR WB
W-7NUPbtWAE,The num 10 of psg is really talene8
W-7NUPbtWAE,"Yellow & Red card for an accidental touch is excessive, just the penalty would've been fine."
W-7NUPbtWAE,PSG rubbed by refree.
W-7NUPbtWAE,He scored confidently 😅😅
W-7NUPbtWAE,"Wolfsburg very poor ball control, easily loosing the ball"
W-7NUPbtWAE,"Absolutely brilliant game of football. Well done to the PSG fans who as always create a phenomenal atmosphere win, lose or draw."
W-7NUPbtWAE,Hardluck to PSG
W-7NUPbtWAE,How was that not a penalty
W-7NUPbtWAE,"Psg players are selfish, first impression"
OyrzxJD3y5M,Handball yes… yellow no!😢
OyrzxJD3y5M,it is clear that the referee was on the side of Wolfsburg.
OyrzxJD3y5M,3:40 dive of the season 😂
OyrzxJD3y5M,"what ruins the beautiful women's football movement are female referees. The one tonight had better raise goats, her kind"
OyrzxJD3y5M,How u can said no fault in the first penalty? Isn’t a error! Anyway poor refere
OyrzxJD3y5M,Terrible decision not to award the first penalty to PSG.
LN5oh1UVSKE,PSG supporters are just vibes. Just singing and dancing non stop 😂
LN5oh1UVSKE,"ahaha.....that is not football, that are women."
fzWicEbqB5w,this game was so chaotic...

fzWicEbqB5w,Woman's >>>>>>>
fzWicEbqB5w,What a weak game!
fzWicEbqB5w,1080p60....why does your coverage always look more like 480p blurred !! and yet your shorten highlights always proper HD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
fzWicEbqB5w,loving your coverage
fzWicEbqB5w,Uwcl referees👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
fzWicEbqB5w,this wasn't De Almeida's game ...
fzWicEbqB5w,"Just one goal 😲 Paris 0:1 Wolf , Lyon 0:1 Chelsea, Roma 0: 1 Barca."
fzWicEbqB5w,"i just do not understand logic behind ""no penalty"" for PSG and second yellow card for handball. It's obviously a foul but why yellow card? That shot is not a 100% goal and there's other defender right in front"
SV87sG3Dti0,"Nice one Chelsea , worked hard with a deserved victory. Those commentators, How poor were they, every comment LYON LYON. really were Negative on the Chelsea moves.. Move on Let someone else have a go"

ZwXPTdflJDM,"Not seeing Jessie Fleming in the important games like this is disappointing.  I hope she leaves Chelsea for La Liga where her minutes would skyrocket.  Say RMA or AM or over to Serie A for say Roma, Juve or Inter.  It was disappointing to hear she signed an extension with Chelsea."
ZwXPTdflJDM,Chelsea are not Arsenal for sure

ZwXPTdflJDM,Selma Bacha I Love You❤
ZwXPTdflJDM,"I know Sams a great player, but seriously Hayse what's with the1 forward and 5 halves against Lyon, your playing defensive not attacking, u need at least two upfront, 4 roving halves an 3 backs. 🇦🇺🌈 That was all Cuthbert, strong, tenacious, Go Woman."
ZwXPTdflJDM,"Both teams seem to love being straight forward, entertaining match. Lyons left back, should get more involved."
ZwXPTdflJDM,Reitens Goal was absolutely sensational1!!
ZwXPTdflJDM,"it may only be 1-0, but Chelsea really lead Lyon on their nose. I sometimes think that they can even beat our men team T_T"
ZwXPTdflJDM,"Chelsea 1 Psg 0
Goal at 39:00 mins of this video"
ZwXPTdflJDM,Chelsea and Arsenal the teams to beat !!!!
ZwXPTdflJDM,so many fans for the team who said they want the big stadium coz they have so much fans
ZwXPTdflJDM,The difference is that the Stamford Bridge (if the girls gonna play another match there) will be full packed. COME ON CHELSEA !! GO GIRLS
ZwXPTdflJDM,the referee really made bad calls against Lyon
ZwXPTdflJDM,Chelsea Football club
ZwXPTdflJDM,Big away win for Chelsea women
DFOqjbCjw5o,Clearly a back pass! Who was working VAR? Stevie Wonder?
DFOqjbCjw5o,Not bad for a women's sport
DFOqjbCjw5o,Wrong there was no VAR or goal line cause Bayern didn’t want to pay for it
DFOqjbCjw5o,that Chinese player is great. in the second leg she was consistent
DFOqjbCjw5o,Foord should have gone for goal with the header...
DFOqjbCjw5o,"ALMOST but Not INSIDE 
,you can cry here: (--_____--)"
DFOqjbCjw5o,ONE DODGY GAME..THAT WAS TWO GOALS ARSENAL LOST
DFOqjbCjw5o,Ref was dodgy in the game but we move!
DFOqjbCjw5o,Obvious back pass
DFOqjbCjw5o,both last night matches made the greatest Champions League night ever

s8bIekbKpx8,"Sweet left foot, brilliant goal!!😁👍😊"
s8bIekbKpx8,im really sorry but exactly where can i see this „stunner“? is there some hidden video linked within this clip? i really cant seem to find kt
s8bIekbKpx8,"When the Barco talent was beyond Roma, one has to look at the coaching to arrive at such a close game. Graham, Mapi and Rolfo were wasted."

IHhUfdvbuus,"The scorelines doesn't do justice to this game, could have been 6 goals to One or two"
IHhUfdvbuus,Barca really knows how to scout their players
IHhUfdvbuus,am feeling funny...by looking this...😅🤣🤣🤣and how the fans are watching this by booking the tickets....🤣🤣🤣🤣they dont know that their cash is wasting🤣🤣🤣🤣
IHhUfdvbuus,Graham what a player.
IHhUfdvbuus,Graham writes poetry in the field 💫
IHhUfdvbuus,Thanks for not giving away the outcome in the thumbnail! I hate when clips do that.
IHhUfdvbuus,Sorry. Can’t watch it. The some money. For what ?!
IHhUfdvbuus,Driblling No 10 of Barca was 🥵🥵🥵
IHhUfdvbuus,womens football really improved over the last years
IHhUfdvbuus,Both keepers are amazing 👏👏👏👏👏
IHhUfdvbuus,"We need to see a super cup style game between the woman’s CL winners vs the men’s under 19’s cup winner, would be so cool"
IHhUfdvbuus,BARCA >>italy.
IHhUfdvbuus,It Was Great and Nice Game For Both Team Great Ladys I Like It
IHhUfdvbuus,Shola not well fed with passes
IHhUfdvbuus,man..this is boring. slow and weak. its like watching a 8th league game.
IHhUfdvbuus,Barcelona's number 20 looks like a dude.. Is that really a woman or a transgender?
IHhUfdvbuus,"Mad respect for roma, only 1-0 against barcelona, they can be proud of themselves"
IHhUfdvbuus,"How truly awful.  Basically a form of cross dressing.No thought for all the long term injuries and effects this will have on them.
Next up: ""men's"" rhythmic gymnastics? 🙄🙄
Clearly the Neoliberal Establishment wants to force this down people's throats. Men have no interest in it. And the overwhelming majority of women and girls have no desire to ""emulate"" men like this. Lets take a step back to common sense and reality.
🤮🤮"
IHhUfdvbuus,Barcelona so dominant it's not even funny. Roma goalie was impressive though
IHhUfdvbuus,Great shots by Oshoala that were only stopped by a great keeper
IHhUfdvbuus,WELL DONE ROME IN THE SECOND HALF.
IHhUfdvbuus,where is alexia putellas🙄
IHhUfdvbuus,The Roma Goalkeeper is Lit
IHhUfdvbuus,Great defent a italyan tim..
IHhUfdvbuus,1  0   away  well don  barca woman's  love  you  all  😍😍  specially  graham hanson number 10   wawo wonderful  excellent 💪
IHhUfdvbuus,i think this barca team can score the male team
IHhUfdvbuus,Graham Hansen is world class!
IHhUfdvbuus,The ladies game are improving rapidly...I'm loving the investment
IHhUfdvbuus,"Jesus Christ it was not Barcelona's #20 game today, she could've had a hat-trick easily..."
IHhUfdvbuus,Do not estimate the Italians!
IHhUfdvbuus,Paredes is the weak link in Barca's defense. Terrible defender. Her performance against Lyon in the last year's final was one of the worst i've seen.
IHhUfdvbuus,Wish they could play the men so they can realize that theyll never get payed the same as men
IHhUfdvbuus,"Well done 👍 to the Roma goalkeeper, she did very well"
IHhUfdvbuus,4:39 what a save🫡
IHhUfdvbuus,Worst defending from roma.. Actually roma gk vs barcelona femenino is the match
IHhUfdvbuus,Great fight from Roma
IHhUfdvbuus,Roma defended well and the goalkeeper was brilliant.
IHhUfdvbuus,"Barça dominated the game both phisically and technically, and yet Roma had 4 clear score opportunities as well: Giacinti x 2, Andressa and Giugliano. I am not counting poor attempts like Havi's and Glionna's, and if I don't, then neither should you on Barça's side. Barça's goalkeeper saved her net just as much as Roma's, if you comment without prejudice. Of course Barça is way stronger and will 99% pass to the semifinals; if they do, I will cheer for them because they are spectacular. But when you compare the two teams you should keep in mind that this one is the first year of professionism in Italy's women football, that this is the very first WCL participation for Roma Women, and that this is the first time they play at home in front of 40k people, whereas in the regular season they play in a 3k people court without any illumination, which forced them to play elsewhere the ""home"" European matches. I could not be more proud of the girls, the stadium was amazing yesterday night, I still have shivers. I never thought I would say this, but Roma Women is reconciliating me with the inherent beauty of the game, whereas the male team (which is the one I root for since I was a child) is all tension, anger and rivalry."
IHhUfdvbuus,is this football or comedy? lol
IHhUfdvbuus,"Brilliant performance from Roma but in Catalunya leg, just forget it. Football is in the same level with Male, more companies are interested"
IHhUfdvbuus,"It's amazing what PR can achieve - you can make people believe there's a pandemic when the hospitals are empty, you can make them take a deadly cure to this non-deadly disease, and you can make them watch women's football!
Edit - that's assuming that all these views are genuine and not paid for, and assuming that those views aren't by mistake..."
IHhUfdvbuus,Parking a bus team
IHhUfdvbuus,"Great game for Salma Paralluelo, and a wonderful Goal!! Barca are so lucky to have her!"
IHhUfdvbuus,Barcelona ran out of gas last 20 minutes which was interesting. Wonder if it was schedule or game?
IHhUfdvbuus,"Oshoala tried, but the Roma keeper and defenders equally tried."
IHhUfdvbuus,Barca's no10 is unbelievable. Her dribbling reminds me of Martha of Brazil
IHhUfdvbuus,Oshoala play well today just that the goal did not come.
IHhUfdvbuus,See you all at the Spotify camp nou 😈😈😈
IHhUfdvbuus,So Roma doesnt have a highlight ? This just a highlight of all the things Barcelona did .and it's very shameful
IHhUfdvbuus,In the first half i didn't see any Roma attempt 😲😲😲. They just came to defend at home 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
IHhUfdvbuus,who's roma goalkeeper? that's dope ... Visca Barca. lets win this title once more
IHhUfdvbuus,This game was entertaining compared to wnba lol 😂
IHhUfdvbuus,We needed more goals in this first leg so they shouldn't have started Asisat Oshoala...Geyse Ferreira was the option
IHhUfdvbuus,Great frikin game and both goalkeepers 😱  👏👏👏👏👏👏👍
IHhUfdvbuus,"Roma have seriously stepped up, that was a great performance from them!!"
IHhUfdvbuus,What deception! Barça could win this game by 3 vs 0
IHhUfdvbuus,Brilliant goalkeeping on both sides. How on earth could this game end with only one goal.
QSbGOx90T1E,what a game! moral score 3x3... 4x4 ... 5x5 ...
QSbGOx90T1E,Graham writes poetry in the field 💫
QSbGOx90T1E,I didn’t realize how bad woman’s football actually was
QSbGOx90T1E,Our women from Barcelona played absolutely top level football
QSbGOx90T1E,Free game. because Barça several opportunities for goals and Roma despite everything could have won in the end so amazing
QSbGOx90T1E,Great game.  Glad to see Roma is so close to join the elite of european football
QSbGOx90T1E,Roma stadium tifo the best🔥
QSbGOx90T1E,"Great game,two super goalies."
QSbGOx90T1E,roma could have earned atleast draw if they had attacked instead of sitting back. Walls are closing in on barca team. Other teams in europe are catching up
QSbGOx90T1E,Amazing game from both teams. VISCA EL BARÇA💙❤️💙❤️

T2GyJbOWsCw,Barcelona the best women's team in the world🔥🔥🔥
T2GyJbOWsCw,Barcelona the best women's team in the world🔥🔥🔥
T2GyJbOWsCw,"Roma's goalie should kick ball out of danger towards midfield instead of rolling ball out, this strategy is a formula for disaster also getting Roma's players exhausted fighting barrage of opponents from scoring so close to goal post."
T2GyJbOWsCw,oshoala has grown yoh! 😍😍😍
T2GyJbOWsCw,"the ref was about to blow the whistle for the foul just before the Barca goal and then tried to play advantage, the advantage went away immediately and she didn't blow it dead. 2 Roma players thought she was going to blow it and didn't pressure Walsh because of it. it's just a pathetic standard of ref, even with VAR in  place. like Barca need any more help."
T2GyJbOWsCw,"Oshuala's finishing and predictability in front of the goal is diminishing rapidly. She needs to pick it up in double quick time, before the second leg."
T2GyJbOWsCw,"Of course, Barcelona is far better but they didn't score a 2nd goal, so, at the end could have been a draw. They must do better against Chelsea or Wolfsburg, otherway... Roma played well, like they have to. .. and ask to Minami : Graham Hansen was on fire."
T2GyJbOWsCw,Im a fans Roma too.. i think roma full lucky against team like Barca
T2GyJbOWsCw,"That Lucy Bronze ""handball"" looked deliberate to me. It's the way she did it."
T2GyJbOWsCw,So Bronze got punched in the face but it was her who got up first?😂
T2GyJbOWsCw,"That's how you do it girls!
Let's go Barça!!"
T2GyJbOWsCw,"I am not a barca fan, but the commentator lucy ward is clearly baised against Barcelona, she is always saying something negative about Barcelona, she needs to do better"
T2GyJbOWsCw,"Don't walk into a dark alley with Roma.
You might win the fight but they'll leave you without a liver."
T2GyJbOWsCw,"Roma         0
Barcelona 1

I believe Barcelona will win 5-0 on aggregate."
T2GyJbOWsCw,Great game Barcelona lead the tie heading home 💙❤️
T2GyJbOWsCw,First. I think?
hvxZUqfRJUo,The best match 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
hvxZUqfRJUo,As a nigeria.i was hoping oshoala would score
hvxZUqfRJUo,congratulations girls keep it up
Y98q0NvZB5g,Bayern kicked Barcelona to the moon and arsenal right after. UNSTOPPABLE. MIA SAN MIA
Y98q0NvZB5g,"The commentary 4 such a big match is so boring, i could fall asleep. Be better next time Vic."
Y98q0NvZB5g,Commentator says defender's arm was clearly in the natural position as the defender extends her arm to stop the ball.
Y98q0NvZB5g,"Your ruining the beautiful game, your embarrassing. Go back to doing your make up and stuff ffs"
Y98q0NvZB5g,What a game 👏
Y98q0NvZB5g,I think Chelsea vs Barca  × Arsenal vs Wolfsburg >> And the Final is BARCA VS WOLFSBURG OR CHELSEA VS ARSENAL.
Y98q0NvZB5g,I think that Arsenals better
Y98q0NvZB5g,You can't call this football surly 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Y98q0NvZB5g,Munich joke by poor referees 👻
Y98q0NvZB5g,"_What up,_ Vicki Sparks! 💖 I see football is as tedious and pointless as it was the last time I watched, 25 years ago. But at least stinky gross boys aren’t playing it now! I’ll check back in another 25 years, and in the meantime keep watching e-sports instead. DougDoug is the greatest athlete of the 21st century, _even if_ he’s an icky, disgusting male."
Y98q0NvZB5g,Bayern Munich has the best defense in champions league 🎉❤
Y98q0NvZB5g,Womens football the joke that keeps on giving.
Y98q0NvZB5g,What a game! Hope Arsenal turns it around in the second leg!
Y98q0NvZB5g,"Bayern  1
Arsenal 0

I believe Arsenal will win 3-1 at home though"
Y98q0NvZB5g,Arsenal plays well but they need a serial scorer. They miss Miedema and Mead.
Y98q0NvZB5g,Tell me the aggregate 🔴⚪
Y98q0NvZB5g,At least it's not 5 - 1
Y98q0NvZB5g,"It's clear what team the ref and VAR favoured tonight. Poor decisions and referring truth be told, how did they miss a clear back pass and penalty is beyond me as they were checked and missed by VAR. If that is the standard of refferring and VAR decisions we should expect in these matches, then the game of Women's football is in even more trouble than I thought."
Y98q0NvZB5g,Cmom Bayern. A nervous win. Will have to step up if we are winning it all  🏆 ❤️😤.

3x0acWj9dJY,The best team in the  womanfootball world .
3x0acWj9dJY,This team plays brand football. One of the best football sides in history for sure.
3x0acWj9dJY,"For people that judge football players only by goal scored, it is hard to quantify the talent of Aitana Bonmati! I see her at the level of skill of the greats like Mia Hamm, Gianni Rivera, Javier Zanetti and Gerd Muller! I believe she is involved in 70% of goals scored by Barcelona!"
3x0acWj9dJY,"Aitana Bnm..Great Skill Individual.☺️🤗🤗😁👍🏻,,...👏👏"
3x0acWj9dJY,She is simply world class 🔥🔥🔥🔥
3x0acWj9dJY,Better than Maguire
3x0acWj9dJY,Aitana in front of goal is deadly
3x0acWj9dJY,"9:18  The no looking pass, as messi did in the worldcup."
3x0acWj9dJY,Rolfo and Aitana being the best players this season for Barca
3x0acWj9dJY,Love these vids

bVVYB-ch_RI,Can not wait.
bVVYB-ch_RI,"2 weeks ago, I would have picked Bayern 100%. But past 3 games from Arsenal have been great from them. I think it's going to be a really close match up between those two!"
bVVYB-ch_RI,Great show with Alex & Lianne. Let us know who you think will win!!! X
bVVYB-ch_RI,im not sold on Chelsea right now.  they looked terrible vs Arsenal.   James disappeared against Catley.
bVVYB-ch_RI,I already have my tickets for the champions league women's final
bVVYB-ch_RI,"Alex hates Arsenal, I heard her on the Arsecast and her suggested XI was the most bizarre thing I've ever heard. She's rooting for Arsenal's downfall, I'm sure of it. Acting like Stanway is going to do anything against Kim Little, get real!"
bVVYB-ch_RI,Lyon win it
bVVYB-ch_RI,Forca Barca for life women's and men's
bVVYB-ch_RI,KATA McCABE IS SUPER AWESOME
bVVYB-ch_RI,"I love Alex and Shebahn opinions and analysis, but Lianne resumes really well every team strenght"
bVVYB-ch_RI,Chelsea Chelsea
bVVYB-ch_RI,Glorious...
bVVYB-ch_RI,These British types are insufferable with the way they talk about the WSL🤣🤣 You would think they have dominated europe for the past 20 years.
bVVYB-ch_RI,Chelsea
bVVYB-ch_RI,lyon will win
bVVYB-ch_RI,More to women power!
bVVYB-ch_RI,Team Chelsea
M7fHHwkWY4s,Hansen has a MESSI DNA
M7fHHwkWY4s,Is it or is it not Caroline ... Why they call her carolina..
M7fHHwkWY4s,Graham Hansen is the best player in the world isn't she?
M7fHHwkWY4s,7 consecutive goal scoring run for superzee asisat oshoola
M7fHHwkWY4s,CGH comeback with fire 🔥
M7fHHwkWY4s,Where is Alexia puttelas
M7fHHwkWY4s,Wonderful match from a fabulous team❣️ but that live texting thing is really horrendous!! And occasionally hilarious; Aitana Bonmatí became antenna bomber tea😂
M7fHHwkWY4s,Caroline Graham Hansen deserves that no.10 on her back and she needs to tutor Ansu Fati on the art of finishing.What a player.This squad is so talented
M7fHHwkWY4s,"Keira, Salma, Aitana and Caroline are on 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
M7fHHwkWY4s,"Besides Hansen magic feet, the pressure of Pina, Geysse, Oshoala, Aitana, AM, Salma in front of the penalty area of the opposite team is crucial."
M7fHHwkWY4s,"Caroline basically said I was never injured, I was just taking an easy break.👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼"

E61Ttb2UpXI,This is so sweet 🥰
E61Ttb2UpXI,I have a cousin from St Albans and I know people from both teams😂
E61Ttb2UpXI,Leah williamson is a legend
E61Ttb2UpXI,"""Who's the naughtiest player?"" Leah and me simultaneously: Katie McCabe"
E61Ttb2UpXI,If you correlate entertainment value off revenue generation - why is womens football disproportionately less entertaining?
E61Ttb2UpXI,Crazy - never heard of a female Champions League till now - but it exists
E61Ttb2UpXI,So now i can Go sleep...
E61Ttb2UpXI,LOVEEE IT ❤❤❤
E61Ttb2UpXI,2.04 Skye mirrors is adorable
E61Ttb2UpXI,England and Arsenal can count themselves very lucky to have someone of Williamson's quality both on and off the pitch.
E61Ttb2UpXI,i NEED more of this 🥰🥰🥰❤️🤍
E61Ttb2UpXI,"The fact that I barely watch womens football, and if I do it's Liverpool, and still I was 100% sure the answer would be Katie McCabe on the naughtiest player at Arsenal really says something."
E61Ttb2UpXI,What a precious wee chat! Skye is adorable and Leah was so sweet with her! Leah Williamson is just brilliant. Love her! ❤
E61Ttb2UpXI,"Kindly her best wish, anyone remains !"
E61Ttb2UpXI,Haha Leah telling skye one of her secrets now everyone knows it cuz it’s on camera 😂

E61Ttb2UpXI,this is adorable.
E61Ttb2UpXI,That was sweet - but not too saccharine sweet. You wait til she’s 16 and gives you a fierce sliding tackle; I can imagine her saying ‘you said we should play to win…’
E61Ttb2UpXI,she's so wholesome with kids🥹
E61Ttb2UpXI,"Leah, Manchester U. The Lady Reds Kids are Bet-tear!"
E61Ttb2UpXI,"Katie catching strays here lol! A lovely video, love my captain."
E61Ttb2UpXI,This was the sweetest interview ever

E61Ttb2UpXI,"Leah and cooking 😂😂😂
I go to different peoples houses hahahaha love that"
E61Ttb2UpXI,awwh this was so wholesome 😁
E61Ttb2UpXI,That’s so sweet
E61Ttb2UpXI,Don’t thing I’ve ever been this jealous of a child before 😭😭
R2G-4t1lXSw,Thanks for showing the women's league games! p.s. Barcelona's home court is Camp nou - pronounced (for English speakers) 😉Camp know (and NOT Camp now) 😉

9eH4L2QQOqA,This commentator makes me switch off sound lightning-quick.
9eH4L2QQOqA,"Lazy camera.  I bet the players hate it.  The only close ups are shots on goal.  
Iguana"
9eH4L2QQOqA,If Barca had Bunny Shaw instead of Oshuala today she would have scored 7 by herself
9eH4L2QQOqA,Vicky López first of many Barcelona goals congrats 💙❤️
-MhwOIPfDlU,Pretty nice win over Barce . . . they will draw Lyon/PSG And lose 😂😂😂😂😂
-MhwOIPfDlU,I'm not a huge fan of these recent highlights videos here. But nice goals and happy to see their celebrations and wins :)
-MhwOIPfDlU,Got progressively stronger throughout the group stage.
-MhwOIPfDlU,"that Benfica (2-3) match was crazy but against all odds (namely the biased referee) Bayern sent them packing, love it!"
bkK9ftTeqDg,Lol women's football that miss Miles over bar from 4 yards lol
Ya72Xs7mcRg,These girls need to convert more. 32 shots only 3 goals
cx0DOJ4Y2Z8,"If only the men could do as well! Brilliant team, can't wait to see what to come for the women 👏"

cx0DOJ4Y2Z8,Proud of the female team
cx0DOJ4Y2Z8,james cele in the thumbnail 🥶
wMijoghVcNg,"Crazy how not even the commentator notices Barca is 10 vs 11 after Engen goes off injured!!
During that period, Patri was immense. 
That said, Walsh still looks lost -- against Lyon or even PSG we'll need to play Engen (hope she's OK) or move Patri back to holding midfield with Aitana and Pina or Caldente in midfield."
wMijoghVcNg,Hearts 💕 💞
wMijoghVcNg,Happy New Year barca femeni
wMijoghVcNg,"here is the goals of the game

A. Oshoala 19:17
C. Pina 42:24
Paralluelo  1:35:40
Paralluelo  1:49:45"
ArptuN0SM5Y,Should be Klara Bühl not Georgia Stanway at 8:52
SlWsNLvryIE,LOVE IT❤
SlWsNLvryIE,"2:08 the fact that she saved that (wrongly given) penalty and then Bayern went on to win the match is just wild, she´s a contender for the nationalteam for sure!"
SlWsNLvryIE,"2:20 best penalty save .. im not sure if she fakes left or was chosing wrong , but fantastich ""wrong handed save """
ab_Mc15ZrcQ,LOVEEE IT❤❤❤❤
ab_Mc15ZrcQ,Caroline Weir 🤍🤍🤍
ab_Mc15ZrcQ,No Chelsea but 2 for Roma 😂
ab_Mc15ZrcQ,Give credit to the passer: Manuela Giugliano
ab_Mc15ZrcQ,Chelsea PSG James’s goal assists should have been on the list!!
ab_Mc15ZrcQ,Bonmati’s backheel assist was nice.

6yt9YHpEtEk,Where is cuthbert's goal against real madrid
6yt9YHpEtEk,Where is Erin Cuthbert's goal?
6yt9YHpEtEk,"*1. S. Blackstenius*

*1B. J. Nobbs*

*2. F. Mannum*

*3. T. Abelleira* 

That’s all Folks!!!

😉"
6yt9YHpEtEk,"I miss Erin Cuthbert's goal against Real Madrid, that was amazing, maybe instead Tere Abelleira's goal that in my opinion isnt very spectacular. I agree with everything else.

Visca el Barça 💙❤"
6yt9YHpEtEk,Jordan Nobbs should win the Puskas Award 2022!! 💖
6yt9YHpEtEk,"Not agree on number 9 , there's better goals thant that one"
qZ8g7B277tM,It's hard to watch all the Men's league tournaments because they're all behind multiple paywalls. I'm glad UEFA are allowing WCL to be streamed for free on YouTube without any regional blocking.
1t26iS76alI,The problem that i have seen in real madrid is  players are playing individually not collectively.As soon as the players realise that football have to be played collectively then real madrid gonna start to play what madridistas wanted to see
1t26iS76alI,"Bravo Vajza ,next year we are gonna be back stronger and stronger 🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱"

mu9I3-gcMc4,At the moment.From Nepal.🎉❤😂
mu9I3-gcMc4,Chelsea Defense passing the ball back always 😢
mu9I3-gcMc4,"Sam Kerr could have scored but passed it to James, Sam Is So Unselfish"
mu9I3-gcMc4,James is very dangerous player. Seems she's played out of her position and yet she's playing to instruction.
mu9I3-gcMc4,Come on Chelsea
mu9I3-gcMc4,"Great game, but what a ridiculous advertising! I'll never buy any adidas stuff again."
mu9I3-gcMc4,Nice to see Grace Goyoro top top player..
mu9I3-gcMc4,"Glad to see, Sam back in form!!"
mu9I3-gcMc4,"How on earth did Jessie Fleming win Canadian player of the year over Kadiesha Buchanan?  Don't get me wrong, I love Jessie, but she does not even get in the starting eleven on a regular basis, where as Buchanan is one of the first names on the team sheet.  Must have been a bit 'AWKWARD' in the dressing room this week."
mu9I3-gcMc4,Absolutely lovely match!
mu9I3-gcMc4,All eleven players involved in the build up to that third goal.
mu9I3-gcMc4,Who is the the head-commentator with the lovely voice
mu9I3-gcMc4,"And the pathetic BLM agenda goes on and on and on,,,,😵😵😵😵"
mu9I3-gcMc4,Sam Kerr is The Goat
mu9I3-gcMc4,"Was great to be at the Bridge to see this, Kerr, James and Kirby were elite in this"
mu9I3-gcMc4,"Great play Chelsea woman, but not as impressive as the female gunners 9:1 against Zurich"
mu9I3-gcMc4,"Fantastic! So the 1-0 in Paris wasn't a fluke after all... 

Come on Chelsea! Up and onwards!"
mu9I3-gcMc4,chelsea for the win

dqNxaf1IDZQ,This has the wrong heading... game is against Benfica NOT Rosengård 😆
dqNxaf1IDZQ,"this commentator is so bad at pronouncing names, Lea Schüller sounds like Schürle, Maximiliane Rall sounds like Roll,
Bühl is wrong too"
dqNxaf1IDZQ,Your caption is incorrect. It should say Bayern Munich vs Benfica.
dqNxaf1IDZQ,2 assists and 2 goals...It's the positional understanding between Georgia Stanway and Klara Buhl.
dqNxaf1IDZQ,"Klara Bühl are amazing and Stanway too and of course whole Bayern women, frauen"
dqNxaf1IDZQ,Sydney Lohmann is indeed the prototype of a tackle fighter....
dqNxaf1IDZQ,The headline is mistaken....It is Benfica not Rosengard....

XisDPkK3MXQ,Interesting video  and amazing too
qG0S79VzHC0,"Lyon v Juventus is the pick of the final games by a mile. Lyon should get at least a draw and go through, but Juve will certainly show up with all guns blazing. Potentially a huge upset. It will be interesting to see how Arsenal progress through this competition, and domestically, after two huge injury blows. I wouldn't totally write them out of the WSL challenge, but they are going to be really stretched to compete for the win in this tournament. Barcelona have been far from perfect in several games this year, but they are still the team you have to beat to win the competition. Game on...."
qG0S79VzHC0,Can't wait to watch Arsenal ladies in black 😍.
qG0S79VzHC0,Love to watch them play
ZhYbMRgowdo,Those Through balls from those Roma midfielders were simply amazing
ZhYbMRgowdo,Catley*. Not Cately. 😅
dIr9tSrNsBk,oof.  lol
W3RZzuAQM9U,"In the 1st half, the Czech goalkeeper was superb, however in the 2nd half, it was mostly Wolfsburg players wasting some great chances"
W3RZzuAQM9U,The keeper needs a trophy 😅
W3RZzuAQM9U,How can you miss all these chances
VN604mGz6FA,BYE BYE DEPORTIVO TACÓN!!! 😂😂😂😂😂 PARA ESO ROBARON AL ATLÉTICO EN LAS ULTIMAS JORNADAS Y ASI CLASIFICARSE A CHAMPIONS?

GiMcWwkCzFE,2:17  Why this play is not between the top 10 clips?    Love it..
GiMcWwkCzFE,Barca improve on utilize created chances
GiMcWwkCzFE,Benfica failed 2 penalties... It should have been 4-6 the result. Gutzy perfomance from Benfica girls. Tried to play eyes on eyes with Barcelona that has 20x the resources. Let's go girls!
GiMcWwkCzFE,Im in love with Cloe ✌️ Benfica ❤️
GiMcWwkCzFE,"Too many mistakes in the back and in the midfield, that can work when you score plenty against Benfica, but in the last 16, it would probably send you home..."
GiMcWwkCzFE,"More fans should be attending such matches,,,,I wish I lived in Spain I could be watching every Barca game"
GiMcWwkCzFE,"they give the passes like crazy and end up losing it, having Walsh on the field to organize and filter the passes without the need for as many as Alexia did.
With Walsh and Ingrid in the middle, Barcelona can do whatever they want in the games."
GiMcWwkCzFE,As a Barça fan I don't think we can classified to the final.
GiMcWwkCzFE,My favorite part was when she said “goal”.
GiMcWwkCzFE,"Wow nice one
Happy to see them winning 🥰❤️😘"
wkE3lvoBBH8,"The talent on Barcelona's team is mind-blowing, just incredible. It's hard to even rank  the players because they're all great.  Take Aitana, Paruello, Mapi Leon, Mariona, Oshoala, Marta Torrejón and Irene Paredes and put them on another team and you instantly have a top two team in the world and Barcelona still keeps its number one status with Alexia, Pina, Graham, Bronze, Fridolina Rolfö,  Paños, Ingrid Syrstad Engen, Esmee Brugts and Keira Walsh"
wkE3lvoBBH8,The game pace is too slow they play in slow motion🤮
wkE3lvoBBH8,why are Barca still putting Walsh on !!
wkE3lvoBBH8,Barcelona femeni graat bounce back in champions league
UeFPExGx5CU,I wanna see more Julia Landenberger. She is great.
UeFPExGx5CU,what a bad referee
UeFPExGx5CU,Gk in women's football lol that's why can't take it serious
UeFPExGx5CU,Stanway i love
7ZWCnO3dt0k,Van de Donk is a genius. She is crazy enough that the players have to be alert and not pass the ball at will
7ZWCnO3dt0k,"this is so bias, shes clearly an arsenal fan"
7ZWCnO3dt0k,YES love these two commentators😇😇😘😘
7ZWCnO3dt0k,"Arsenal women to night were tired sluggish slow ro the ball, Leon won the tackles. they did not deserve to score.  Maanam was terrible, constantly running into danger, but Blackstenius was the worst, she is simply not a Arsenal Team player,. The Manager lost this game tonight thpough reason being he could see that the women were back passing so much it felt we were playing totally the wrong way that we beat ourselves. Catley I AM NOT A FAN OF BUT SHE IS MY PLAYER OF THE MATCH  she did her job and more. The commentator  said they need magic huh? but she seen the same thing that the back passing was so so so shocking we had four players most times in groups and Raffaelle kept back passing not looking forward. Miedema and Mead missing injured badly."
7ZWCnO3dt0k,Will this live be posted when it’s done
7ZWCnO3dt0k,"Lyon has so much injured players ... I hope it will be ok tonight. 
Horan is brilliant."
7ZWCnO3dt0k,I hope Catarina Macario would be soon back into the squad!
Q_wm422mRJQ,Alexia the goat
Q_wm422mRJQ,Renard's words are surprising after a 8 month when she said Aitana I think she will say Alexia kerr popp or something but aitana is the best player in the world right now she said she was not lying
Q_wm422mRJQ,no SAM KERR!!!! YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. THAT GIRLS IS A LEGEND!!!!
Q_wm422mRJQ,"No Sam Kerr? Figures. But then again, she is out of this world! 😊"
Q_wm422mRJQ,"What is so fantastic is that there is a real conversation to be had about the top players, it's not just 2 or 3 here and there, but quite a wide pantheon of greats. Just think about 15 years ago!?! We've come a long way."
Q_wm422mRJQ,"Indoubtedly all very, very worthy football players (with my favourite of the lot mentioned here being W. Renard) but once again, short of both literally & figuratively ‘walking on water’ I just wonder how much longer it will take for *Scotland & Real Madrid* midfielder *Caroline Weir* to finally get the respect, recognition & appreciation she so sorely deserves. And even more importantly, has (way, way) more than earned in her career thus far, as well."
Q_wm422mRJQ,Pernille Harder. Hope she comes back stronger. 💙🙏
Q_wm422mRJQ,The Queen Alexia 💙❤

i6Dl080ytro,"Very bad TV direction. Too much close ups while football was being played. I think the TV director, only football did not want to show us. Anything but football. All he was interested in, was pretending the artist. TV directors of football think they make art."

5kt7GfuvVo4,What were they playing for??
5kt7GfuvVo4,All these goalkeepers 🤦🤦
5kt7GfuvVo4,They play great!
5kt7GfuvVo4,"The reality: Bayern two goals in 10 minutes and the rest of the game locked in their area with great fear. Barça was better in 90% of the game, they had many more chances and the referee forgot to whistle a clear penalty. This is the truth."
5kt7GfuvVo4,Why is Oshoala always on the bench? They lost because they did not have a Poacher
5kt7GfuvVo4,Men or women don't matter. Barca always becomes the victim of Bayern's wrath.
5kt7GfuvVo4,I kind like how barcas main players were injured for there to be a more fair match 😅 I’m a barca fan and I wanted to see them have a tough match but not lose of course. Bayern deserved the win regardless!
5kt7GfuvVo4,Thomas muller is smiling now..
5kt7GfuvVo4,Since when did Barcelona hire failure
5kt7GfuvVo4,"Bad defence, bad goalkeeping,   poor offensively, many turnovers, in general, a poor game by Barca, congrats Bayern, Giraldez needs to bring out new ideas since last 2 games were quite below standard"
5kt7GfuvVo4,"Fantastic job from Bayern and well deserved win. From a Barca fan, i agree with some comments about or Game Style, we need more variations and open the field.
I have confidence in a Champions League win this season. But they are not perfect and we must recognize the great level of other teams too."
5kt7GfuvVo4,Congrats Bayern
5kt7GfuvVo4,Possibly the best performance Bayern has produced. They were at it all game. Played with real guts and determination to stop Barca from developing any sort of momentum
5kt7GfuvVo4,Barcelona dominates their domestic Leagues but not the Champions League.
5kt7GfuvVo4,We always threaten everywhere. #Munchens

5kt7GfuvVo4,"So unexpected, to be honest I wrote Bayern off after they were overrun in the first game"
5kt7GfuvVo4,"barca need more variation in attacking, they just became crossing fc at this point"
5kt7GfuvVo4,Bayeren Munich owned Barcelona lol 😂
5kt7GfuvVo4,shocking game. we have to do better if we wanna win the champions league.
5kt7GfuvVo4,Thoroughly enjoyed this one.
5kt7GfuvVo4,"What an absolutely brilliant game to watch. Bayern were incredible even win Barca throwing everything at them. It wasn’t a pretty game, it was certainly a tough one where both teams left everything they had on the pitch."
RNkLmrZyuBw,Nice game!
RNkLmrZyuBw,Marla Grohs is fire 🔥.  1 mistake comparing to 50 great saves. So what....
qfPpM_1XgQE,Whether it is a man's or women's football bayern always destroy barca

qfPpM_1XgQE,Bayern womens team is better  than barcelona  mens team  (Thomas muller)
qfPpM_1XgQE,Barcelona should just tap out anytime they hear Bayern coming at this point... It's getting embarrassing...
qfPpM_1XgQE,Barca won the first leg 3 0 💪💪

qfPpM_1XgQE,Where is Alexia Putellas? She still without play but She still receiving the Ballon d'Or
qfPpM_1XgQE,Very unfair and exaggerated result. Bayern four shots three goals. 90% of the time locked in their area in fear. Barça more chances and more dominance but no luck. And a clear penalty that the referee did not indicate at the hands of Bayern.
qfPpM_1XgQE,Great performance by Bayern!
qfPpM_1XgQE,much deserved win!
qfPpM_1XgQE,Almost Copy and paste of Barça weekend. Jonathan have to find solutions quickly

a4qBlMqpd-0,I'd not seen Sydney Lohman that much. I put special attention to her in this game and I've realized that she's just awesome. She does everything right. What a talented and elegant player she is. World class midfielder.
a4qBlMqpd-0,"So many mistakes from Barca players, particularly from LB and RB. Rolfo and Bronze were horrendous tonight not covering their positions in both Bayern goals. And the misses from our Attackers were critical.This was a copy paste game with Lyon's final in Turin."
a4qBlMqpd-0,"Barcelona home game 4-0 Barça win.

9SXeas62eiM,Has she not been scoring ? Oshoala creates chances does more of assisting.  When she is alone they don’t give balls.  Describing her as a trunk or mediocre is in a bad taste somehow.
9SXeas62eiM,"Biased English commentary, sounded like he wanted Barça to lose. Sociedad played well but Barça were more than capable of winning this match. Commentator must be neutral. Visca Barça. Lucy Bronze, Bronze, Bronze! 
❤️💙❤️💙❤️💙"
9SXeas62eiM,"Quite a bad game coming from Barca's side, both offensively and defensively, these things might happen, somehow they managed to pull thru, although a more focused Sociadad should have been better with the chances they had, Giraldez acted well as he should in halftime"
9SXeas62eiM,They almost lost the game! But still they managed to recover… luv Lucy Bronze… can’t wait for Alexia to come back and play with Lucy

Yoejbiqstzo,I felt pity for Miedema. The Arsenal coach never played her in her prefer position after Blacksteinous come to Arsenal. Miedema is more clinical and can score more goals.

Yoejbiqstzo,Arsenal failed to score a lot :(
Yoejbiqstzo,Too many wasted chances

IHOIAg217B8,"The talent on Barcelona's team is mind-blowing, just incredible. It's hard to even rank  the players because they're all great.  Take Aitana, Paruello, Mapi Leon, Mariona, Oshoala, Marta Torrejón and Irene Paredes and put them on another team and you instantly have a top two team in the world and Barcelona still keeps its number one status with Alexia, Pina, Graham, Bronze, Fridolina Rolfö,  Paños, Ingrid Syrstad Engen, Esmee Brugts and Keira Walsh"

0d_7PwXWLw4,😅 the commentator
0d_7PwXWLw4,Without Messi barca not famous and strong. Messi is the Queen of Chess. Messi aura and power give to barca women's team individual quality that's why barca strong😂😂😂😂 from me Messi Messi Messi from me north Borneo Malaysia😮😮😮😂😂😂
0d_7PwXWLw4,I still don't think Spain will do well in the world cup without all this experienced barca players in that squad
0d_7PwXWLw4,Barca overpowered them in all areas of the field
0d_7PwXWLw4,"Please never let this commentator do a liga f game again, clearly had done no research and had no clue what they are talking about. So many names pronounced incorrectly and massive pauses in the middle of sentences. Genuinely makes this broadcast with sound virtually unwatchable."
0d_7PwXWLw4,"Why do so many broadcasters keep employing this commentator? She is absolutely USELESS. Not only can't she string together a full sentence without stopping for a few seconds after ever 2 or 3 words, which causes her commentary to lag 5 to 10 seconds behind the game, but the words coming out of her mouth frequently bear no relation to what's actually happening on the field in the first place. 🙄"
0d_7PwXWLw4,1:21:20 In what universe is that not a yellow (or even red) card? And this: 1:34:50 ?
0d_7PwXWLw4,"I'm sure this commentator is a lovely person and all, but her commentary is woefully amateurish, sorry."
0d_7PwXWLw4,Crazy to see Barça level without Putellas and Graham-Hansen !
0d_7PwXWLw4,The big fight between our Rolfo and Athenea is electric 💥💥💥💥
0d_7PwXWLw4,Keira Walsh has avenged his revenge with Real Madrid
0d_7PwXWLw4,For Real Madrid I would bench Esther. She needs to stop flapping her gums and playing football instead. She's a detriment to the team week in and week out.
0d_7PwXWLw4,Poor Misa. She's in the wrong team.
0d_7PwXWLw4,"Dear Senior Vilda;
The first job of a football manager is to get his team of players to play for him and commit to his ideas.
If a team and a half (18) of the world's best players are not persuaded perhaps you should retire to an administrative post and let a real football coach and leader of women take over.
Drafting a 3rd choice team under penalty of death from Florentino and the Federation does not seem like an viable option if winning the World Cup is the objective.
If establishing fascist, Castilian rule is the point, well maybe...."
0d_7PwXWLw4,Anybody know why Misa was angry with Aitana at the end?
0d_7PwXWLw4,What’s with these Brazilians that think the ball belongs only to them!😡
0d_7PwXWLw4,Vilda in the mud
0d_7PwXWLw4,"Without Alexia, without Graham Hansen and without Mariona, Barça Femeni still overwhelmed Madrid"
0d_7PwXWLw4,BallonDor athenea is in pocket 😂
7em5faz-Cqc,"So, who's the real Madrid? Madrid CFF or Real Madrid?"

DwQz98wQ8PI,"the penalty save was with her ""wrong "" hand , brilliant ... watched Caroline weir do that the other day , nearly spilled my tea!"
DwQz98wQ8PI,That's some stupendous skill from Weir 👏🏽. Absolutely sumptuous piece of play.
DwQz98wQ8PI,Caroline Weir is the best of all🤍👑🙌🏻 Future ballon d’Or winner if she continues like that… Sweet Caroline
DwQz98wQ8PI,"Keeper was well off her line for the pen, but it was a beautiful save regardless."
DwQz98wQ8PI,"Absolute class from Caroline WEIR Super player ❤️
Oberdorf & Aitana 👌"
xcPT6em3ZXI,super saved Plenty BM GK wonderfull comeback B_M 🔴🔥 2 Gole down
xcPT6em3ZXI,German football commentary is quite the _golden_ experience.
xcPT6em3ZXI,At 35 : 19 it was an obvious foul against Miss Bühl & must have been a penalty. The referee was not fit for CL.
xcPT6em3ZXI,"Cumbria's finest, the pride of Barrow. The ONE, the ONLY Georgia Stanway. Proper!"
xcPT6em3ZXI,"Great comeback, but the penalty should have been taken over. She was over the line 😅"
xcPT6em3ZXI,Stanway is turnt for that
xcPT6em3ZXI,"Georgia Stanway! What a player🤯 I'm a huge fan!
She's got an iron will to win, she is extremely important for Bayern - I'm so glad she joined my favourite team 🤍❤
Get well soon Lina Magull🙏"
xcPT6em3ZXI,"Great match. It's a shame Benfica lost, but that's football."
xcPT6em3ZXI,Staying power 🇩🇪
xcPT6em3ZXI,great game
xcPT6em3ZXI,Bayern goalkeeper didn't have one foot on the line for the penalty
XfoNUg4JrBk,Is no one gonna talk about that penalty save?
XfoNUg4JrBk,The referee failed. It was a striker foul and no penalty....
XfoNUg4JrBk,"Cannot give Stanway that amount of space, she's incredibly dangerous."
XfoNUg4JrBk,Benfica's goalkeeper is at the very least laughable
XfoNUg4JrBk,Stanway is the bomb
XfoNUg4JrBk,Stanway🎉
XfoNUg4JrBk,"Er, think goalkeeper off her line for the penalty"
XfoNUg4JrBk,Stanway is way above most other players. Only a few can match her skill and attitude! Well done!
XfoNUg4JrBk,Stanway to the rescue and an excellent a penalty save from Grohs. Game Changers.
XfoNUg4JrBk,"6:23 no penalty .., kama about to happen"
XfoNUg4JrBk,Georgia Stanway = 👑
XfoNUg4JrBk,The keeper kept them in the game lets not forget
XfoNUg4JrBk,"The Pen should’ve been retaken, GK was off her line"
XfoNUg4JrBk,"Always said I would love Chelsea to have signed Stanway , she is an excellent player ."
XfoNUg4JrBk,keeper was way off the line for benfica penalty.. female refrees are not upto the mark.. seen a lot of offsides given when not.. clearly off the line here 😑
XfoNUg4JrBk,Benfica - Rosengård will be war
XfoNUg4JrBk,Are the PK rules different for women's soccer? Because that goalie was way off her line before the Benfica player made contact with the ball.
XfoNUg4JrBk,"🎼 Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through
Just two nice sweet goals
Keep Georgia on my mind...🌹🍺..."
XfoNUg4JrBk,"Georgia Stanway has a reputation of winning games in a tight situation, just like she did in quarter final Euro 22 vs Spain."
XfoNUg4JrBk,The Amazing Georgia Stanway!! 😀
XfoNUg4JrBk,"Stanway only scores screamers, what a baller 🔥"
XfoNUg4JrBk,"Great seeing Stanway 🦁flying the 🇬🇧flag high, what a super talent 👍🏾"
XfoNUg4JrBk,What a match Benfica will feel very hard done by but Bayern Munich came back very strongly thanks to a certain Georgia Stanway!
XfoNUg4JrBk,The Fraulein's team's Limey bird is quite a tasty little darlin'.
XfoNUg4JrBk,Thats what you get for diving. Karma
XfoNUg4JrBk,Here we are with Bias ref. 👎👎
XfoNUg4JrBk,The referees in this year’s competition are terrible. That was a blatant foul in the lead up to Stanways second. Great goal though.
XfoNUg4JrBk,Stanways’ on fire 🐐

N4tuQgRgPnM,"What a performance from the Barcelona women 
Wish the men could"
4NYZWcRaO-Y,Julia Grosso the best 🤍🖤
4NYZWcRaO-Y,Barca women always beated Juve and Arsenal... But Lyon always beated Barca...
4NYZWcRaO-Y,Lyon Women always strong if they fight against Barca women😱..
iPoWXwzwoKI,Sam Kerr is fire.
iPoWXwzwoKI,Chelsea number 11   and  20
iPoWXwzwoKI,"This Chelsea women's team is awesome. They literally have 4 world class or near world class forwards in Kerr, Harder, Kirby and England. At least 1 of them 4 would always be in form"
iPoWXwzwoKI,So great
iPoWXwzwoKI,the girl of fifa 23

iPoWXwzwoKI,This is what I expect from chelsea men not those nonsense they are playing
iPoWXwzwoKI,I could sleep off watching this match 😂😂😂. Our ladies absolutely exterminated them but congrats to my Chelsea girls.
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten was unbelievable. Could have had like 6 or 7 assists in a single game. Insane
iPoWXwzwoKI,5:21  Beth England watching Sam's backflip after her hattrick... 🥴
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Big club, lower grade pitch for team women with the poor camera set up locations👎. Sorry for the Chelsea ladies 😕"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Bro I can’t see other team chance
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Nah, the women football and it's officiating needs improvement fr, the 3rd goal came from a throw in! The ball had already gone out and so many offsides 🤧🤧"
iPoWXwzwoKI,The backflip though 😍
iPoWXwzwoKI,Swear down Rieten got that 99 crossing and vision....and with Kerr's 99 finishing....its comes Easy2 😏
iPoWXwzwoKI,"This ain’t real football, it’s one big joke, get over it😂"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Sam Kerr is from another planet what a player the Australian is
iPoWXwzwoKI,Karr is supposed to win ballon’s
iPoWXwzwoKI,Transfer Reiten to the men's team. What an absolute delight to watch. Player of the match for me.
iPoWXwzwoKI,They spelt the opponent team name with 8
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Abdullina can also play at left back.  She and Reiten have very similar running and crossing styles.  If they team up down the left, they'll be a nightmare for opposition defences."
iPoWXwzwoKI,I was in there 1:22
iPoWXwzwoKI,I was in there 1-22
iPoWXwzwoKI,"As a Dane im so proud of Harder..... as a Liverpool fan  i dread  when  the teams meet the next time , eventhough  we beat chelsea 2-1  in the last one"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten is the Female Goat Left wing back
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten was out of this world so on point!!!!!
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten was out of this world so on point!!!!!
iPoWXwzwoKI,Kerr and Harder sure but this was all about Reiten for me! Wow 👏🏻
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Dreadful commentary,but great performance for the ladies ."
iPoWXwzwoKI,I like how when they score they always celebrate and thankful to the player that assisted the goal . Not like the men who score and are just look at me look at me
iPoWXwzwoKI,Chelsea on form
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Reiten👌👌👌👌👌Kerr 💪💪💪💪 Harder👍👋👋 the best in this match was Reiten
men's team needs someone like Reiten 👌"
iPoWXwzwoKI,So nice to see so many couch Chelsea supporters showing their support for their team unlike last night at Kingsmedows where they could not be seen or heard over the away supporters 🤣🤣🤣
iPoWXwzwoKI,Up the blues
iPoWXwzwoKI,Bro the opponent is playing like 9 year old
iPoWXwzwoKI,fewer camera angles on the english production than on other european WCL fixtures
iPoWXwzwoKI,"9 times champion of their league and they got Whoop 8 to no 😹 

All other team of their league would be like how. Real definition of local champion 😹"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Excellent from chelsea
iPoWXwzwoKI,"USWNT and Lyon women ripe to be upended next year, should be interesting."
iPoWXwzwoKI,Lowest low block I’ve ever seen
iPoWXwzwoKI,Watching the women is better than watching the men honestly
iPoWXwzwoKI,"as we celebrate Reiten, Kerr, Harder.....let's not forget Ingle and Flemming ran the midfield too"
iPoWXwzwoKI,"That harder pass 2:17 
Sheeeeshhhhh 
🐐thing you know"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Harder deserves ballon d'or shouts
iPoWXwzwoKI,Abdullina Alsu was one of exciting future hope she get more chance nice skill.
iPoWXwzwoKI,Sam Kerr is not from planet earth
iPoWXwzwoKI,"“Now a Party Political Broadcast by the Kerr and Harder Party.”

5:50 “I’m surprised she didn’t injure herself with those backflips”"
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Reiten, Harder and Kerr are absolutely world class."
iPoWXwzwoKI,Abdullina’s crosses were awesome hope she gets more game time
iPoWXwzwoKI,Lol massive deflation for that assist  but no one mentions it not even them deadarse comintaters
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Reiten's crosses are venomous like Reece's, and her corners are better than anyone’s of the men's team."
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Well done ladies, what a great win!!! #KTBFFH 👏🏾💪🏾💙🔥"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Nice one Chelsea
iPoWXwzwoKI,R they that ok or is the other team that bad? Can’t tell sorry
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten could have had 10 assists in a single game.
iPoWXwzwoKI,So that’s how the girl from fifa plays
iPoWXwzwoKI,Second goal Harder watched KDB clips 💙 for life.. I love this team
iPoWXwzwoKI,Quality players
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Gawd the standard is dreadful, it looks like a schoolboys game. And to think these teams are the top level of women's club football in Europe.
I've seen international games that are terrific but this was very mediocre."
iPoWXwzwoKI,Chelsea proved they can beat small team well.
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Never stop playing Harder, Kerr and Reiten together💙💙🫡"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten is a baller and Chelsea are ruthless nice to see Kirby back
iPoWXwzwoKI,Deadly front 3💙💙💙
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Reiten is Magic!
What a football Brain!"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Harder tho!
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Kerr coming third in the Ballon d’Or once again this year proves that you have to play in the European league in order to win, especially so if you play for Spain. It’s rigged against anyone playing for an English team despite Kerr deserving to win the trophy!"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Rieten easily the man of the match or should I say woman of the match
iPoWXwzwoKI,"WOW! What a night for Reiten. What, 6-7 assists? Reiten destroyed them!"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten is every forwards delight and great to have Kerr and Harder on point.I bet Emma was buzzing watching this
iPoWXwzwoKI,Omo na volleyball Dem play for here
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten could let all the blind score
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Chelsea (W) be having too much fun😊
C'mon you Blues💙💙"
iPoWXwzwoKI,How does this awful stop-start commentator keep getting games?
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten has more reliable delivery than FedEx
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Well done to the women's team! So lucky to get to watch Kerr and others play for Chelsea. 

Up the Chels!"
iPoWXwzwoKI,Pernille Mosegaard Harder is the best and beautiful football in the world 🔥
iPoWXwzwoKI,Reiten has been involved in a lot of goals lately #KTBFFH
iPoWXwzwoKI,This team is going to win champions league
iPoWXwzwoKI,Kerr should have had another assisted by Reiten at 3:53 cuz that was not offside
iPoWXwzwoKI,"Chelsea are miles ahead of this Team ok 
That score line shows the difference between tow Clubs ☹️


Congratulations to Chelsea Football Club and hope you win this competition this year 🤔"
iPoWXwzwoKI,These English teams like to play with more possession of the ball dawg.
iPoWXwzwoKI,Hat tricks galore 🤣
iPoWXwzwoKI,"these young ladies from Albania have won their league nine times, yet come to London and get battered by the BEST women's team in the country 8 - 0, so that begs the question, How BAD is that league that they play in???🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔"

vUMAImED1GY,"I mean Wolfsburg is like 50% German national team players so it was just the question how high they will win.
But the singular chants by those few guys sure are funny to hear."
SXxtjZlMPig,Blackstenius is the most badass name I ever heard…sounds like marvel hero or something…lol
SXxtjZlMPig,"Horan the fast Renard teams eat it just like Le Somer Terrible, Lyon literally had no speed on the wings, they were playing with full-backs as wingers, which did not work"
SXxtjZlMPig,Bacha shouldn’t play at fullback it make no sense
SXxtjZlMPig,"Love the way Lyon ran to get the ball back after they scored, like they were hungry to concede more 🙂"
SXxtjZlMPig,"mbock the strong black was not here too. Cascarino, Marozsan, Hegerberg Dabritz and Macario  Majri ect..."
SXxtjZlMPig,"disaster.....where is Cascarino,Heldeberg.....the team is like a sinking ship......hope they recover"
SXxtjZlMPig,Absolutely brilliant showing by the Arsenal girlies…
SXxtjZlMPig,Arsenal both male and female are on fire
SXxtjZlMPig,It's time wendy should think about her retirement. No doubt that she is a legend in women's football. Poor display of football by leon. Why are their top strikers missing?

Jm1YZS0gATs,Beth Mead been robbed of the trophy. How can Barcelona player won when she was injured for long time. Corrupt BallonDor
Jm1YZS0gATs,"I’m not even an Arsenal fan, but so impressed by this performance.  Really hope they go far in the CL this season.  Team full of ballers, and of course Meado! What a player she is."
Jm1YZS0gATs,"Arsenal, what a team 👏❤"
Jm1YZS0gATs,Such a disgrace that no Norwegian media have put this up as a story with Frida Maanum as a Gunner.
Jm1YZS0gATs,I want to see a training session between Arsenal Men and Women's team...💓💓

Jm1YZS0gATs,"What did Miedema do? She doesn't lead the line anymore, she plays midfield, I'm not a fan of that. We could do even better goal-wise if she was our striker."
Jm1YZS0gATs,Make me a sandwich
Jm1YZS0gATs,Woman’s football is funny. They all act like men.
Jm1YZS0gATs,Thank you Arsenal .... You dud well.

Jm1YZS0gATs,8 minutes?? what highlights are that lol
Jm1YZS0gATs,And imagine Williamson and Miedema didn’t play!
Jm1YZS0gATs,We are the Gunners ❤️
Jm1YZS0gATs,Probably just a bad day at the office for Lyon cos at their best they thrash anyone
Jm1YZS0gATs,"England have the best female and male leagues, won the U19 Euros, women's Euros and the Ballon dor awards gave all the awards to La Liga players because FIFA have an agenda against the English."
Jm1YZS0gATs,"Beating champions league champions a whole 5 goals is beautiful to watch, both arsenal senior men team, women team and academies are all beautiful to watch, what a time to be an arsenal fan 💞"
Jm1YZS0gATs,Beating the Lyon 5 is just beautiful 💞
Jm1YZS0gATs,That was impressive from Arsenal. They're showing they are real contenders this year.
Jm1YZS0gATs,The form is both side of the gunners
Jm1YZS0gATs,What’s the point of this football match? Women’s football is irrelevant 🥱
Jm1YZS0gATs,"when this Lyon women's team win rampart barcelona women's team, I might not go for Arsenal for a victory.. but well, congrats.."
Jm1YZS0gATs,What team!
Jm1YZS0gATs,You're champions but we're arsenal
Jm1YZS0gATs,mead was on fire last season she deserve that golden ball most definitely robbed hopefully she can same amount numbers like last season 🔥
Jm1YZS0gATs,"Huge crowd again for ladies football , I see . Wondering if the revenue from tickets even paid for the stewards on duty ???"
Jm1YZS0gATs,It's such a shame that the stadium was so empty. The level of football the women's teams are playing deserve better than that! Great result!! 🔥
Jm1YZS0gATs,"Maanum, Walti and captain Little just bossed it. Great performance 💪🏼"
Jm1YZS0gATs,Terrible defensive line and terrible passing from Lyon
Jm1YZS0gATs,"Painfully, Arsenal Women is even superior than Men. Mikel Arteta will never win a Champions League with men."
Jm1YZS0gATs,How did Beth not win the ballan dor? I do not know🤷‍♂️
Jm1YZS0gATs,"So So Glad at this Scoreline... 
Infact I'm so satisfied...,☺️
Hopefully Barca would inflict a heavier defeat should they meet this time around...."
Jm1YZS0gATs,Captain Dr Kim little was solid
Jm1YZS0gATs,Absolutely cracking
Jm1YZS0gATs,What a performance from Arsenal women!
Jm1YZS0gATs,"This women’s team will be champions of england and europe, the boys will follow soon 😉"
Jm1YZS0gATs,"Even with lot of injuries in the team, big ups arsenal. 💪🏽"
Jm1YZS0gATs,Now that’s what you call a result. 🎉
Jm1YZS0gATs,Bead took Ballon d'Or robbery personally
Jm1YZS0gATs,great to be Arsenal fan nowadays ☺
Jm1YZS0gATs,i'm in love with Beth Mead
Jm1YZS0gATs,Lyon is like the Real Madrid of UWCL. Don't ever rule them out. They are a wounded beast now
Jm1YZS0gATs,Just so everyone knows who the best team in the world really is...
Jm1YZS0gATs,Arsenal women is a great team
Jm1YZS0gATs,"Unbelievable performance Gunners❤️🤍, let's keep it up 👌🏾👏🏾this will be our season🔥"
Jm1YZS0gATs,That’s my FAVORITE TEAM IN THE WORLD❤️❤️❤️❤️😭👏🏻absolutely an outstanding performance⭐️couldn’t be more proud to be a gunner❤️
Jm1YZS0gATs,Ajax whipped Arsenal into CL shape.
Jm1YZS0gATs,"Brilliant game Arsenal 👏👏❤️❤️But I wonder why Viv played only 15m, what’s going on ????."
Jm1YZS0gATs,"Such a great win, well done , Ladies👋👋👋"
Jm1YZS0gATs,"Congrats to the gunners, especially to that fantastic Matilda Foord!"
Jm1YZS0gATs,Wow gunners! Thank you.
Jm1YZS0gATs,Lyon will still win the champions league.
Jm1YZS0gATs,"Wooo that was terrible, congrats Arsenal 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾💥💥💥 As i said this year UWCL will give us lot of surprises n heart attack 😁"
Jm1YZS0gATs,"Imagine Arsenal Mens & Women's team WIN the league, UEL & UWCL together this season.. that would be the most beautiful moment in football history.. SLEEPING GIANT IS BACK !!"
Jm1YZS0gATs,Congratulations to team arsenal.
Jm1YZS0gATs,GREAT RESULT GREAT PERFORMANCE WITHOUT 2 OFF OUR BEST PLAYERS ASWELL 💖💖💖
Jm1YZS0gATs,What happened whit the Lyon’s defense!
Jm1YZS0gATs,Kim Little was anything but little.....she ran the show
Jm1YZS0gATs,Wow! Scoring 5 goals even without Miedema. This team is amazing. I feel like this year's Arsenal women's team can achieve quadruple like their seniors did in 16 years ago.
Jm1YZS0gATs,"If Lione will lose the next one at Juventus home, happened last year, we would have the uefa champions almost eliminated after 2 games, it would be sensational"
Jm1YZS0gATs,"I still can't believe this was a real match 😳🤩
COYG"
Jm1YZS0gATs,Lyon has to work harder.
Jm1YZS0gATs,Beth Mead ! From a rainy night in Reading on Sunday to a black dress and heels on a Monday to scoring a pair of goals against the Champions League holders Lyon on a Wednesday 💅🏼
Jm1YZS0gATs,Sombath Thailand 🇹🇭
Jm1YZS0gATs,We are back to stage 🔴⚪
Jm1YZS0gATs,What an unbelievable and incredible result tonight! Up Gunners! This is our season for sure
Jm1YZS0gATs,Oooof!!! Beth Mead. What a great weapon to have in your Arsenal. (Shhh you see what I did there) Carry on.
Jm1YZS0gATs,"WOW,,SUPER AWESOME ARSENAL ❤❤❤"
Jm1YZS0gATs,"Would've been better to play this game in a smaller stadium for a better atmosphere instead of pretending that the demand for women's football is more than it actually is. Anyway, well played Arsenal!! 🔥"
Jm1YZS0gATs,What a disatrous defeat for Lyon. They were gunnered by an Arsenal team on fire. I am still impressed
Jm1YZS0gATs,"I’m not an Arsenal fan by the way. Wanted to watch this but was at the same time as my teams game in the Premier League. Wow, to go to the home of 8 time European Champions and batter them 5-1. Arsenal are unstoppable so far this season and definitely one of the favourites to win their 2nd UWCL."
Jm1YZS0gATs,COYG
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,best team in the world
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Bro what
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,They’re playing against bots
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Benfica was very close to have a draw.
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Less competition in any game is boring 😑
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,What's the point of a team like Benfica being in this competition if their players played like they were not interested in being on the field from the very start.   The Benfica players attitude was disgraceful.
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,https://youtube.com/shorts/X-fObbgGaR4?feature=share shorts here😁
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,can somebody tell me why this team is not in fifa 23 ea has to do something about this
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,why are they not adding this team in fifa 23 it's really disappointing
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Could have easily been 15-0 plus
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"And because lawlessness is increased, most people’s love will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end, he shall be saved.—Matthew 24:12-13"
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"The benifaca's number 14 is just a joke to Women's football.
Most of the goals were conceded by her fault and laziness😅😅😅😅😅"
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,This no 9 is somewhat selfish.  Unlike Azeezat that was playing with the team.  She is concerned with scoring
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Mariona best player ever by far
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,It looks easy cos it is barca femini doing it...
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,An Arsenal v Barcelona final would be highly entertaining indeed. I only found out this summer that Liverpool had Asisat Oshoala for a season a few years ago. Can’t believe we let her go.
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Lyon Women is the best Team in the Europe.. Barca Women is the beauty football in the europe.. USNWT ( USA) IS THE BEST TEAM IN THE WORLD..
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,They are like angels 💙❤
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Benfica player on 8th goal 🤣🤣
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"Great victory, and yet the real test will come with OL, PSG, Arsenal... I hope Barça has learnt something from last season's defeat"
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Asisat O is not really wanted or rather liked by colleagues.
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"Despite the missed chances, 9?"
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Profesionals. Great team !!!
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"Not being a racist catcher, but i feel Asisat osaola is envied by her white colleagues...Most of the passes where aimed away from her"
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,This team have a chance to win the championship this year.
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"And thats without Alexia, CGH, Walsh.."
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,I just wish the men could emulates these women
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Xavi needs to see how Barcelona REALLY played.
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"Look  at Bonmati, she control that midfield those amazing foot works and pass, hats off wow she's a key player."
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Barça. The best in the world 🏆⚽
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Woman team plays better than man
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Oshoala 2 assist two goals super player
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Mannnn!!!can't believe I missed this one!!  The Lyon-Arsenal was the surprise of the evening for me
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"Bonmati has regained her match sharpness. Every player for every other team is now depressed. Great team performance, though a few were under par on the day. I wish Engen could play every game, but when you have captain fantastic Patri it's hard to get Engen on the field but she's superb at putting out fires."
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,And this is without their star winger Caroline and 2 time ballon dor winner Alexia Putellas. Mapi Leon's understanding of the game is on another level. Never seen a CB who controls the game like she does. Genius
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"Dissatisfied,  many wastad chances"
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Mariana caldente very smart player😍
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"Really strong team, they will be hard to beat!
I especially love Mapi Leon. Not the one we see the most but she got a brilliant vision of the game and can turn the whole pitch with one pass. In most of the goals tonight she was involved at the start, such a great playmaker!"
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Barça is the Best Team.
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Without Alexia and Graham
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Can't wait for the Queen Alexia to come back from injury
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Why 9-0? Because nobody cares
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,When barca men will be at the same level.
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Asisat does it so effortlessly.
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Oshoala carried this team last season. And she's about to do it again
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Great performance by Barça... but Benfica That's just lazy defending... They looked like they were being forced to play
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"I'm really proud of my team.
Everything about the 6th goal was a vintage Barcaesque goal. Gave me chills to be honest. A lot of missed chances in the 1st half but made up for it in the 2nd. What an amazing start to the UWCL campaign. I hope Laia is ok, I missed Caro today and as always, FORCA BARCA💙❤️"
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,And this is without the two time reigning Balon D’Or winner
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,That's my barca
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Engen & Rolfö....former shewolves 💚🐺💚
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,"This is why, i only like FC Barcelona Women"
3PrZ_HBvEfQ,Benfica is suffering
9SK-lTDFa3U,Mariona very smart player😍
xXzISKMqD1c,Meanwhile barcelona just hammered Benfica 9-0
xXzISKMqD1c,Something tells me that this Bayern women's team is somewhat weaker than expected. Chance for Barcelona to take revenge is here.
xXzISKMqD1c,Silly directors who focus the camera ON THE BALL rather than enlarging the view for us to see the whole action !
xXzISKMqD1c,first payment date 21 goals
xXzISKMqD1c,It was more difficult than expected to win for Bayern.
LA8pAg3sFic,Only Cheisa and Pogba can change Juve's Fortune 😐
LA8pAg3sFic,Just something to laugh
LA8pAg3sFic,Unfortunately both teams are just playing for the third or fourth place in this group
LA8pAg3sFic,first payment date 21 goals
WPUoCuu1Dms,"Lyon is really going downhill this time. Losing 1-5 to Arsenal as the defending champions, go Juve!"
WPUoCuu1Dms,Björki 💚🐺💚 wish she would still playing for Wolfsburg
WPUoCuu1Dms,first payment date 21 goals
9QSWqI3stII,"I still believe football commentary can be a lot better. I would prefer it to be a lot more technical. I want to learn how tactics work out, why person X is setup as a attacker., the degree of luck in the current score result. Such things."
9QSWqI3stII,Donate to help pay my way through school. https://gofund.me/a9f56b4b
9QSWqI3stII,So do we really need the DAZN app if we can just watch the matches on here???

H17FTd31o3I,We had Messi and now we have Putellas 💙❤️
H17FTd31o3I,Sam Kerr should have won it
H17FTd31o3I,"I think Beth Mead is very unlucky not to win the award, particularly considering Beth's outstanding performances in the Ladies Euros this summer, a far more prestigious tournament than a champions league. I think there is always something a bit loaded in favour of Barcelona players with these awards - male and female."
H17FTd31o3I,That second goal was so hard to watch 😖
H17FTd31o3I,Have her play in the men’s team and see how she does
H17FTd31o3I,"What a player, she's great, our queen, our team, visca Barça."
H17FTd31o3I,The Queen
H17FTd31o3I,"She never played in the Euro's, how did she win. Mead won  the Golden boot & the Trophy, lost the WSL by a point. Barcelona would never go unbeaten in the Super League."
H17FTd31o3I,there is hegerberg why not dior balloon champion because lyon is a loser and won in the champions final through the referee🤮🤮🤣🤣
H17FTd31o3I,"No hate to her but how can any player win the ballon d'or without the champions league or wining major competitions with the national team
make it make sense"
H17FTd31o3I,"It was a robbery, sorry👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"
H17FTd31o3I,"So well deserved!! Eat this, Jorge Vilda."
H17FTd31o3I,By the numbers? From what planet? she didn’t win the champions league nor did she participate in the WEUROS . Domestic 🏆’s only. Ballondor is a joke. Go back to school and study math people.
H17FTd31o3I,She is the best. The queen!
H17FTd31o3I,well deserved! she's a baller!
H17FTd31o3I,"Facts are facts, stats are stats. Queen Alexia. The Greatest!"
H17FTd31o3I,Beth mead was clearly robbed. Definitely a fix.
H17FTd31o3I,Sur win What this year ?  Nothing   England win european champion league and Lyon win wcl
H17FTd31o3I,I think Sam Kerr is better than her
H17FTd31o3I,The Queen 👑👑❤️

9HlVX4P3n3Q,"February 2025
Interesting seeing the Gunners before Emily Fox  . How embarrassing that Beth Mead stuffed up the first corner kick of the game  ( must be filling in for the injured Brasiliera )
NOW the all new improved Gunners have 
( 1 ) Katy McCabe  ( only equalled on the left by Mary Fowler  ) 
( 2 ) Kyra Cooney -- Cross  right foot specialist .
SO no other team has so many dead ball specialists  when you count Caldentey & Catley  as well❗️"
9HlVX4P3n3Q,"why i can't watch it live?? it didn't work it says "" this video is not aviable"""
VJrys-WKTGE,"Goodness me Patri's surname is not Gutierrez, it's Guijarro. It's not a name hard for native English speakers to say (I would know because I am one) - I don't think it's a tall order to expect a commentator to know the names of the players."
VJrys-WKTGE,"DAZN… this commentary is nothing but giving a different name every ten seconds even if they’re not on the ball and even if he can’t be bothered to learn the names - cite: the painfully frequent “Gutierrez” for Patri Guijarro - mixed with the occasional stating when a free kick is being taken or that Bilbao should be happy they’re not getting totally thrashed. I’m not sure it could even be called “audio description” it’s so empty, let alone “commentary” since there’s no commentating in the slightest. Not sure the guy knows the teams or the game, and there’s zero evidence either way.

DAZN produces some high quality content so it’s painful to see it being let down by not being able to hire someone with both expertise and commentating ability (maybe it’s empty due to lack of knowledge, or maybe he knows stuff but doesn’t have the radio mind to actually say any of it - or maybe, neither) to do the commentary. Hope there’s someone better for the Champions League since DAZN has the rights for that, too. But hey, if you’re still looking, I’m free."
VJrys-WKTGE,"Commentary..other than you usual comments re keira walsh's tranfer fee, she wasnt mentioned again, didnt notice she was even playing, she just doesnt fit into the Barca team.....swap her back with Leila !"
VJrys-WKTGE,Is the thumbnail Atletico Madrid? Shouldn’t it be Athletic Bilbao..?

HPMUDWl-gTw,"Now this is the sport that needs super league tournaments with those teams from the USA it could be something special coz its still in development phase around the globe, Clubs from Australia Japan most of Europe n USA, still Bravo DAZN for the coverage of this comp. It's been a breath of fresh air and it will continue to get better 👊⚽"
HPMUDWl-gTw,"Womens football (Soccer) has been treated like a joke by the Patriarchal society, We have had to fight to get any acceptance, respect and so many other advantages that have been automatically given to the Males of the game. I'm an ex Matilda and had to play on cricket pitches, paddocks, we even had to wear the men's old jerseys and buy our own shorts, sock, boots and pay full fare to wherever we were scheduled to play and you know what, I was even proud to do that because I was playing for my Country. But now I stand up strong, proud with tears of joy in my eyes, when I see a little 6yr old girl pulling on a new jersey, playing on proper pitches and she turns to me, smiles and says One day I'm going to be like you Coach, my hero. Thankyou to all who have helped raise our game to the amazing level we see today and What a Great Game it is!!🇦🇺🌈⚽️🥇🏆"

HPMUDWl-gTw,"Awesome, can't wait. Some interesting rematches from last year : 
PSG - Real Madrid (the Real were mortified with 2 losses, I predict they will be a tougher opponent this season)
OL - Juventus ( Juventus created the upset in the 1st leg of the quarterfinal ) 
Bayern - Benfica ( Benfica held the Bayern to a scoreless draw )
Also who will come out of group B ? Wolfsburg - likely - but who else ?"
HPMUDWl-gTw,I hate the draw system for the UWCL. They shouldn’t do this “Red/blue” split. Just the country restriction. So Madrid should be able to draw any group not containing Barcelona and arsenal any group except Chelsea.
HPMUDWl-gTw,"Tough groups, should be a brilliant competition this season."

aSUZwe2y-eY,Awesome free kick by Léon! Now I'm waiting for comments how every 3 m tall men goalkeepers would've saved it 😅
aSUZwe2y-eY,Awesome performance by Barcelona women tho
aSUZwe2y-eY,This Villarreal girls are funny. They at the way the celebrated when they got one 😂
aSUZwe2y-eY,MAPI IS SUPER AWESOME 😎💋💋❤❤❤

RmEQfY3M5E8,WoW! Whats a Game!! Incredible level of women's football in Spain
RmEQfY3M5E8,Thanks for the upload 🙂
XOyQFG0kTY0,"It's a travesty that CGH has not been nominated for a Ballon D'or, look at the content she gives us year after year!"
XOyQFG0kTY0,Shows how much they miss Putellas. They made really heavy work of what was an easy fixture. The secret plan is out though - they bought Lucy Bronze to be their striker.
XOyQFG0kTY0,A beautiful rocket. I loved seeing Keira Walsh in the shirt...Hoping the new players settle in quickly.
4JUMPGMzoJI,"You BARCA Girls are so great.  Mapi, I love it when you charge the goal.
Iguana"
4JUMPGMzoJI,"the people towers are awesome right,     im like no dont do that you'll hurt yourselves"
4JUMPGMzoJI,"Walsh seems like a mistake. 
If there was that kind of money, why not Oberdorf?
In any case, Engen improved the flow of the game when she finally came on. She's much improved from the start of last season.
...
Walsh parece un error.
Si había esa cantidad de dinero, ¿por qué no Oberdorf?
En cualquier caso, Engen mejoró el flujo del juego cuando finalmente entró. Ha mejorado mucho desde el comienzo de la temporada pasada."
4JUMPGMzoJI,Really enjoyed this
4JUMPGMzoJI,Oshoala should move to PSG or some other team that will appreciate her skill and speed.
4JUMPGMzoJI,they were played off the park in the european cup ... played off the park
4JUMPGMzoJI,Get well soon patri
4JUMPGMzoJI,I'm a simple guy. I see Barça and I click

4JUMPGMzoJI,Wonder what the attendance was
4JUMPGMzoJI,Barca femeni is back
DWbe1DiYNjk,Completely agree
DWbe1DiYNjk,"About a year ago one of the Liverpool journalists had a weird twitter rant mocking Chelsea for celebrating the women’s team, it was really strange. So it’s not really a shock they don’t do enough for their women’s team is it?"
DWbe1DiYNjk,"I'm proud of my club Chelsea, both the men and women's team always compete at the highest level. KTBFFH💙💙💙"
DWbe1DiYNjk,"Wait what.. please inform yourself when talking about equal pay for uswnt.. uswnt were offered equal pay (same contract as usmnt) but rejected (!) It, because they wanted financial security so they themselves signed a completely different contract than the usmnt but both would still get around the same amount. They noticed they could've made more money if they would've signed the contract they were offered in the first place and so they demanded they would also get the bonuses the usmnt team would get, what would mean unequal pay for usmnt. They started this media campaign that there was unequal pay and almost everyone felt for it.. hey in the end us soccer even paid them millions.. not because uswnt were right about the demands but because of public pressure.. even president Biden was involved. With other words uswnt deliberately lied and discriminated usmnt and got away with it."
DWbe1DiYNjk,"Ian Wright Wright Wright, sure you're Right Right Right 🎶🎶.

The women's game shall keep going from strength to strength. Can't wait for NLD at the Emirates."
DWbe1DiYNjk,"Making womens football more accessible by streaming matches for free on platforms like YouTube, fa player has made huge changes"
DWbe1DiYNjk,"Liverpool can do that with ease, as for Manchester United?
There is no ambition with the Glazers.😠

Hopefully they qualify this season for the UWCL ahead of Man City."

Zc8Wn1OZvgc,"Portland should have won this game,Chelsea extremely fortunate to escape with the win...

Raquel 'Rocky' Rodriguez and Sophia Smith with Christine Sinclair in the whole really turned the dial in this match. unbelievable squad."
Zc8Wn1OZvgc,"It's really frustrating that Emma is playing like Tuchel... arlegic to substitution 🙄🙄 
Already 60 mins and no fresh legs 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️"

3nCvY4d4Hi0,Endler is definetly world class goalkeeper
3nCvY4d4Hi0,She is not pronounced as Avana Donk....Its Van Donk...The Kommetator
3nCvY4d4Hi0,Subs tactics need to point at the weakest position but not random subs......
3nCvY4d4Hi0,Lol that miss gonna go down in the history of women's meme football
3nCvY4d4Hi0,Lyon the best👍
3nCvY4d4Hi0,"Chelsea had that, subs blew it. But that's okay, you learn more from a match you lose than from a match that you win <3"

K0Jsa8Ul3xw,Portland's lack of finishing made me sad

K0Jsa8Ul3xw,Hopefully this tournament will be hold every year
K0Jsa8Ul3xw,Wonderful goalkeeping from Monterey. Absolutely brilliant penalty saves.
dX5TWRUVElI,Inferior commentary once again.
dX5TWRUVElI,When is the final ? French time and day ?
dX5TWRUVElI,Sam Kerr is probably quite disappointed Emily Sonnett is no longer playing for Portland.  She was Emily's worst nightmare back in nwsl.
KDRLrqWIQFA,"Danielle van de Donk made the difference for Lyon.
Massive players"
KDRLrqWIQFA,Only preseason luckily. come on blues!!
KDRLrqWIQFA,"upset by Emma, not the girls"
KDRLrqWIQFA,"Chelsea were stronger, but eventually lost. How can this be?"
KDRLrqWIQFA,"That was a lesson to Emma Hayes not to do some unnecessary and untimely subs in the next women's champions league which is also against international clubs again, hopefully she takes that😁😊🥰"

OGwC9QRKZcM,Such a great documentary about the women's Chelsea team. I give it a solid 10.

OGwC9QRKZcM,subtitles/ closed captions pleeeeaaseee
OGwC9QRKZcM,No but a season 2 with all that went on in the 2021-2022 season is seriously needed
OGwC9QRKZcM,Didn't realize they'd wrap up the entire 2020-21 season in 20 minutes. Bit disappointing but overall series was great
OGwC9QRKZcM,no CC only in the last episode?
OGwC9QRKZcM,We need more content like this. Thank you for making it.

OGwC9QRKZcM,next season`s champions league should be ours
OGwC9QRKZcM,We need this type of documentary with Arsenal Women
OGwC9QRKZcM,This whole series is absolutely brilliant!
OGwC9QRKZcM,This has been brilliant to watch. Thankyou.
OGwC9QRKZcM,"It's just a little more time before we win the champions league. Barca feminine lost their first champions league final, won it the next season and lost it again the next season. We lost our first champions league final and it's only a matter of time before we finally lay out hands on it. We have conquered everywhere but Europe, we don't want to be local champions, the next vision is to be the European champions. We are on course to do it. Come on you Blues. 💙💙"
OGwC9QRKZcM,"Great docuseries! It was so compelling and well edited that it kept me on the edge of my seat even tho I knew the outcome of all of the games and transfers.   
Thanks to all for the work and the club for the courage to share what’s behind the veil.  It’s so inspiring.  And Emma’s words at the end should be on a poster or painted ion the walls.  Please do a season 2!  KTBFFH!! Up CHELS!"
OGwC9QRKZcM,Love it :) I want to see more of this.
OGwC9QRKZcM,And the Emmy for best... Literally everything goes to..
OGwC9QRKZcM,"2m30s just gone like that, the documentary is so interesting i felt like the time wasted was too much 😎😎😎"
OGwC9QRKZcM,"Absolutely enjoyed these, Laughed and cried my way through them. So proud of these girls they’ve gained a new fan and I’ll be cheering them on this season. 💙"
OGwC9QRKZcM,"Emma Hayes You are something else,
Great work Lady."
OGwC9QRKZcM,"Thanks for a great documentary that really showed us a glimpse from behind the scenes. Really interesting to follow the players and staff, the ups and downs and everything in between. 

It made me appreciate even more the work everyone puts down and how things affect them. It's not often people think about the people at the club and how, at the end of the day, they are just normal people. We see them on the pitch and on social media, but it's not really getting to know them and the stuff they go through. 
This made it more personal. 

This series really showed how hard it is as a player to not getting enough playing time and having to make the decision to stay or leave. 
I felt Deanna Coopers struggles and felt really sorry for her. I also saw Jess Carter finally getting her chance and throughout these six parts go from perhaps not doing quite enough and not really hitting the right level, to grow into a strong player who is just getting better and better. And now she's in the England squad heading to the Women's Euro 2022. 

I hope to see a second season of this series."
OGwC9QRKZcM,Hopefully season 2 captures the champions league win. That's what we're aiming for. I trust 'em. Great work 👏🏽
OGwC9QRKZcM,"Emma was like Arsenal women are the dominant team in England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿, so she wants to take that from them .

And she absolutely did so 💙💙💯💯"
OGwC9QRKZcM,"Wow,I totally loved this documentary and everything about it,the resilience of the team, the willingness to fight and come back stronger,I just hope we finally get our hands on the UWCL next season."
OGwC9QRKZcM,Season 2 please 😌😅💙💙
OGwC9QRKZcM,Is this the final episode? 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
OGwC9QRKZcM,sub please
OGwC9QRKZcM,tq so much for this documentation. hope you make season 2💙💙
OGwC9QRKZcM,I believe strongly we gonna win that uwcl no matter what cuz even the men went through the same struggles before winning the super cup & club world cup to compete the set. we definitely gonna win it. up the chel's 💙💙💙💙
OGwC9QRKZcM,This was quality- what a watch 🤍
OGwC9QRKZcM,We need more. Great series
OGwC9QRKZcM,Mahn this is really the ending 😭
OGwC9QRKZcM,That champions league finnal hurts 🥺🥺 deep
OGwC9QRKZcM,Season 2 at Barcelona!
OGwC9QRKZcM,best womans football reality doc ever
OGwC9QRKZcM,I think this season is our's to get our hands on the UWCL trophy 💙
OGwC9QRKZcM,"What an Amazing Series ,great insight really of behind the scenes of Chelsea Women's Football club"
OGwC9QRKZcM,"37:59 what a joke that was . worked every workday , no furlough for me every fkn day"
OGwC9QRKZcM,UWCL... we are coming for you💙💙💙
OGwC9QRKZcM,What a documentary
OGwC9QRKZcM,"Emma's last comment absolutely says it all; equality, in football, equality in life. BLUE forever, whoever your are."
OGwC9QRKZcM,"I was at that FA cup at the end there, was so gassed, proper chels that"
OGwC9QRKZcM,Thank you so much for doing this!!!
OGwC9QRKZcM,Wow my team Chelsea women
OGwC9QRKZcM,"Emma is just different gravy, everything she says is just class"
OGwC9QRKZcM,"Well, this last episode was a dogs breakfast.  Very disappointing and discombobulated.  The first 5 episodes spanned 1/2 a season; the last episode 1.5 seasons.  Crazy.  I get that Covid threw a spanner in the works but the editing for this last episode was just terrible.  The producers should've stuck with the original plan for 8 episodes (at least) and collected more interviews remotely or after being able to return post-lockdown.  They really do need to do a season 2 now, to make up for this mess."
OGwC9QRKZcM,Need season 2
OGwC9QRKZcM,I love watching Chelsea ladies more than Uswnt! Can’t believe I’m even saying that but I’ve been following for 5 years now
OGwC9QRKZcM,We need season 2😢
OGwC9QRKZcM,Emma being cold🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
OGwC9QRKZcM,Great series tbh💙
k9K64NdTr9E,"What about Rolfö, Crnogorcevic and Martens, all three playing for Barcelona last season?"
k9K64NdTr9E,"Portugal only came here thanked to Russia being banned for invading Ukraine. Literally, Portugal also has no equivalent of Cristiano Ronaldo in women's squad. Chance? Zero.

Switzerland's performance has deteriorated rapidly after 2021. I doubt if they can progress either.

Netherlands and Sweden are easy choice to progress though. The Dutch have a squad strong to depth, although under Mark Parsons, he is doing more damages than achievements - probably the English really hate the Dutch. Sweden has won once, and I hope they will conquer it again."
k9K64NdTr9E,we gonna watch live on dazn?
k9K64NdTr9E,WHEN YOU PLAY FOR YOUR COUNTRY THERE IS NO FRIEND SHIP
k9K64NdTr9E,Here first and when is the next episode of one team one dream coming out
jvLX_CnQgUA,"+ Bühl + Lohmann. In fact all their players, Germany has such a strong team and such a strong bench"
jvLX_CnQgUA,looking forward to watch the euro. :)
jvLX_CnQgUA,Great players!
jvLX_CnQgUA,IT WILL BE GERMANY OR SPAIN
jvLX_CnQgUA,My Team ❤️
HQ9jyfjRzys,"Berger is a weird pick - I'm pretty sure Frohms will be at the goal for all of their games bar some injury or sudden drop of form? Why not, idk, Magdalena Eriksson and Aniek Nouwen?"
HQ9jyfjRzys,"Spain is an one-woman team, same to their men's counterparts, or maybe worse - their only superstar is Alexia Putellas and nothing else. Jorge Vilda lacks the charisma of Luis Enrique to run the game and lessons from Euro 2017 and World Cup 2019 show that, when Spain is overrated, Spain tends to explode itself. Germany and England taught them hard back then and this will be the same. Spain will fail before the trophy.

Germany, being a superpower in women's stage, is definitely the best team in this group and has the highest chance to progress, but Germany is no longer the lone superpower of European women's football anymore and it will be harder for them to win again.

Denmark will be a mystery and Denmark can also inflict surprises against both Spain and Germany, and, I expect the Danish women's side will not make the same mistake against Finland like their men's team (which lost 0-1). Sorry Finns."
HQ9jyfjRzys,"WELL SHE IS HARDER,,LOL"
Wf5c8chs27U,"🚨 Binge watch all of One Team, One Dream: This Is Chelsea right here 👉 https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrUQXESZrdvr4CIGrSM2NZr3VnZlJTRng"
Wf5c8chs27U,The women’s building compared to the men’s absolutely ridiculous!
Wf5c8chs27U,"Great team. My number 1
I will always support this team. Up the Chels"
Wf5c8chs27U,"I don't understand how people that love football can be a team player, I like player like ramona never be on to be in the bench."
Wf5c8chs27U,I have really enjoyed these siries
Wf5c8chs27U,The way Arsenal have started this season we will need a similar performace against them home and away .
Wf5c8chs27U,"Proud of my Swedish girls Magda & Jonna! ❤You are truly team players and show the same you behind the scenes as we get to see in public. I also feel very sad for Sam!

Ramona Bachmann had her peak at a very young age. She started playing in the Swedish league at the age of 17. At that time, women's football was mostly professional in Sweden & Germany. Bachmann and Marta were the big stars in the Swedish league. Ramona was a goal machine. And then other European countries and clubs started to invest in women's football. When she started playing in European clubs, she hasn't performed well at all. 

Many players tend to become great players and more complete the older you get. But in her case, it has been the opposite. When she was young, she was the big star. And the older she's gotten, the worse she's gotten. I don't like her behaviour, but I can still understand her. I think it's been difficult for her to go from being the big star to being benchwarmer. Accepting it! While Ramona was at her best in the Swedish league, Magda was a bench warmer. Now she's captaining her team. 👀Just a thought!"
Wf5c8chs27U,"Am not even a Chelsea fan so far have watched this series but haven't heard any encouraging, kind words from Emma as a coach. You either play well or be kicked out of the starting Xi and she is always using cursing words."
Wf5c8chs27U,"Cooper got messed around, played 7 league games in her last 3 seasons."
Wf5c8chs27U,"After watching this series in comparison to the Lionesses preparation for the Euro, I have a whole level of appreciation for Sarina Wiegman’s style of management. The England team were spot on serious, but clearly enjoyed their practice. Sarinna Wiegman would point out what could be better, instead of beating down players for their mistake. I wish Chelsea women luck in the CL."
Wf5c8chs27U,I love Magda so much. She's such a strong personality and an excellent player
Wf5c8chs27U,I really feel for Cooper. She was so well behaved
Wf5c8chs27U,How many episodes?
Wf5c8chs27U,KTBFFH Chelsea!!! 💙💙💙💙💙💙
Wf5c8chs27U,Support from Turkey 💙💙💙
Wf5c8chs27U,Great
Wf5c8chs27U,Azpi and Magda moment is literally melted my heart 💙 I love to see my captains!
Wf5c8chs27U,Thanks DAZN for sharing this series 💙 #COYB
Wf5c8chs27U,I really love this documentary!
Wf5c8chs27U,Thank you so much for making this series and especially as a Chelsea fan myself. I have developed a bigger connection to the club now. I will support our women’s team with the same passion as our men’s 💪
Wf5c8chs27U,I definitely think they should make more these types of series for both the men and women games.
Wf5c8chs27U,ive never really heard EH say anything related to futball. all the coaching is variations of “play better”
Wf5c8chs27U,This is absolutely fascinating. I’m low key hooked on this series lol
Wf5c8chs27U,Ramona was an opp
Wf5c8chs27U,I didn't like the way they treated deanne Cooper
Wf5c8chs27U,"Think this should replace Coronation Street, Amazing stuff! Soo excited for the Euros! Go England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 and Norway 🇧🇻!!"
Wf5c8chs27U,I'm stuck on the Deanne cooper game time situation....it's so unfortunate...I just hope Emma has a plan on squad rotation rather than making players to sit on the bench for that long cause I believe everyone at Chelsea women is competitive
Wf5c8chs27U,"This documentary so far has opened my eyes to know more about women football, being a professional footballer and being a Chelsea woman football club player. Clearly there are more to being a footballer than what goes on on the pitch. The real deal are what goes behind the scenes. I love these series. 👍💙"
Wf5c8chs27U,cool
Wf5c8chs27U,I'm not even a Chelsea fan but I really love this series. Other teams need to do this as well
Wf5c8chs27U,One thing I live for is Chelsea 💙💙💙💙💙
Wf5c8chs27U,This documentary is very interesting.  I can't wait for the male's especially with Lukaku's situation because football is not just about playing and fans watching
Wf5c8chs27U,I’m sorry but deanne cooper cries a lot I think she cried 3 or 4 times in this series
Wf5c8chs27U,"I’m a Man City fan but am really enjoying this!
Shame Chelsea were shamefully HANDED the title this Season (try telling Pep “you’re in the lead but hey, we’re going to give the Title to Chelsea, ok?”  Would NEVER have happened 😡) so might have to miss the end of Season episode as it would only cause me to rant!"
Wf5c8chs27U,"Magdalena Eriksson, what a classy player and captain."
Wf5c8chs27U,Bring next episode thank you
Wf5c8chs27U,"I see a lot of myself in Bachmann. I've been my own worst enemy several times. I've needed to smile and be supportive of others when I wasn't feeling secure myself, too. I guess it's easier to see when it's someone else : )"
Wf5c8chs27U,Episode 5 - not close-captioned. Will it be fixed?
Wf5c8chs27U,"I find it interesting which players they decided to highlight/focus on. Very little Kirby, Magda, Millie, Ji…. Some of the most important players to the squad."
Wf5c8chs27U,"The only thing that i've put ""notification on"" on youtube is this series. Excellent stuff. And im not even a Chelsea fan."
Wf5c8chs27U,its funny how this team won week in week out yet there was so much tension in the squad
Wf5c8chs27U,Its just a matter of when for chelsea to win the champions league. Emma is managing the team alright
Wf5c8chs27U,"Sam Kerr 5:38 : ""In the men's game you have to play well to belong.  In the women's game you have to belong to play well"" ... Seems like nonsense to me.  Would've thought belonging & playing well go together just the same for both men's and women's games.  But interested in peoples thoughts on this..."
Wf5c8chs27U,I really enjoyed watching this documentary
Wf5c8chs27U,"Ramona was her own worst enemy.  Her lack of team-first attitude and focus on herself first was clearly a factor affecting her role and priority in the team.   The immaturity is a bit of a surprise.

EDIT:  After reflecting on this further I think maybe Emma should've done a better job with Ramona too?  This series glosses over what went on but it's hard not to get the impression Emma should've done more to refocus and remotivate Ramona."
Wf5c8chs27U,Every episode convinces me even more Emma is not the manager to take Chelsea to the next level.
Wf5c8chs27U,"Interesting episode but it's clear now this series should have twelve parts, not six... It will be absurd to have it end just when things start to get interesting with progress in uwcl, etc."
AwrfDeGbiHU,A player like her deserves a much nicer statue than that!
AwrfDeGbiHU,"YES, this woman is the milk. We need more statues of women like this who're absolutely 100% beast.
I swear this woman ain't even human and I was one of the first to see it. I knew Vivianne Miedema was Vivianne Miedema before even Vivianne Miedema knew she was Vivianne Miedema. Rose Lavelle is next. You heard it hear first."
AwrfDeGbiHU,"absolute legend, well deserved!"
AwrfDeGbiHU,The GOAT!
AwrfDeGbiHU,That’s amazing it’s rare to see any player get a statue while they’re still playing
AwrfDeGbiHU,And yet... Sam Kerr is a beast !! 😂 Sam Kerr is the Goat of women football 🐐
AwrfDeGbiHU,"Hope Miedema is healing at home and feeling better.
Looking forward to seeing her in NZ/Aust at the WC 2023.
Go well Viv 🧡"
AwrfDeGbiHU,Fabulous player and a remarkable human being. Looking forward to seeing Viv represent NL at the World Cup next year. Adore her English spoken so clearly with a Dutch-Glaswegian accent 💜
AwrfDeGbiHU,Keep simple Miedema you are the best!
AwrfDeGbiHU,"Vivianne is an absolute class act both on and off the pitch. Her work with common goal, the less fortunate children, gender equality is commendable. While on the field, her goal scoring exploits are second to none."
AwrfDeGbiHU,"A great striker,much love n respect from Nairobi Kenya.
A die-hard Arsenal supporter"
AwrfDeGbiHU,"A woman 
Playing football what is this madness"
AwrfDeGbiHU,Viv keep going! You and all the females football players deserve only the best!!!
AwrfDeGbiHU,*Also do this year in Barca Femini! They are an unstoppable force 🔵🔴*
AwrfDeGbiHU,"Let's be realistic here, and a sense of proportion. Never heard of this player, and her team is not among the best even in England."
AwrfDeGbiHU,"What an excellent choice. I see her on and off the field as someone I would hope young girls and boys would emulate. She is respectful, dedicated and humble. I am thrilled"
AwrfDeGbiHU,the 🐐
AwrfDeGbiHU,"You deserve everything Vivianne Miedema. It’s Amazing, Fantastic, Brilliant 🥰😊👏"
AwrfDeGbiHU,Greatness!
AwrfDeGbiHU,katie and rusha will take turns on Pidgeon maintenance
AwrfDeGbiHU,Amazing and well deserved. 😍
AwrfDeGbiHU,Where do you go from here?? 25 years old and already has a statue!
AwrfDeGbiHU,Great stuff. This  is quite similar to Zlatan getting a statue when PSG brought him. Hope Miedema stays at Arsenal and keep winning trophies.
AwrfDeGbiHU,Hopefully the statue gets moved to the Arsenal ground
RycT_eBYAz0,Another day another great goalkeeper
